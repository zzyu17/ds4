# QA Before Releases

This is the release gate for DwarfStar.  Run it before tagging or pushing a
release build.  The goal is not to prove every code path exhaustively; it is to
exercise the paths that have historically regressed: Metal graph inference,
CUDA, ROCm, SSD streaming, distributed execution, disk KV cache, server APIs, and the
agent TUI/tool state machine.

Do not run multiple huge model processes at the same time.  Record the commit,
hardware, GGUF file, context size, and any non-default flags for every manual
run.

Preferred release test hosts:

- CUDA / DGX Spark: `toor@192.168.4.180` and `toor@192.168.4.181`.
- Metal / distributed Mac testing: `mac-m5max-it` and `mac-m5max-us`.
- ROCm: The Strix Halo system at antirez@strixhalo (Framework Desktop).

`192.168.60.250` is permission-only. Never connect to it for QA, stop or start
its server, build there, or run tests or benchmarks there without asking
Salvatore and receiving explicit permission for that specific QA pass. Earlier
permission does not carry over to later work.

The Mac hosts have DNS entries and are reached through an internet VPN.  They
are connected to each other over WiFi and also through a Thunderbolt 5
point-to-point link.  The TB5 route is the preferred distributed-inference
network when it is available, but it can be fragile and sometimes only works
when `ds4` is executed in the foreground.  Prefer these machines for release
testing, especially distributed inference.  Local fallback testing on this
machine is acceptable when needed; it is an M3 Max with 128 GB RAM.
The Strix Halo system is reachable via the VPN as well and has a local WiFi
address in the same lan of the M5 Max systems. The CUDA hosts are in a
different remote lan and are accessible via a different VPN active
in this system.

## 1. Repository And Build Sanity

- Start from a clean tree except intentional release notes:
  `git status --short`.
- After fetching a bundle, rewriting commits, or resetting a remote test tree,
  force a clean build. Do not trust incremental `make`: restored source mtimes
  can be older than a stale executable. Record the tested binary's commit or
  verify it was rebuilt from the selected tree before running remote QA.
- Build the normal local target:
  `make clean && make`.
- Build CPU-only binaries as a compile check only:
  `make clean && make cpu`.
- Treat compiler warnings as build failures. Save each release and test build's
  complete output and require no `warning:` or NVCC `warning #` lines. Fix the
  source when possible; use a narrow target-specific suppression only when a
  test deliberately compiles a partial translation unit.
- Repeat the warning-free build gate on the release hardware:
  `make clean && make` on Metal,
  `make clean && make cuda-spark` on DGX Spark,
  `make clean && make cuda-generic CUDA_HOME=/usr` on the multi-GPU CUDA host
  only after receiving permission for `192.168.60.250`,
  `make clean && make strix-halo` on Strix Halo.
- Run whitespace checks before committing:
  `git diff --check`.
- Confirm `./ds4 --help`, `./ds4-server --help`, and `./ds4-agent --help` render
  cleanly, with readable section colors and no broken wrapping.

## 2. Core Regression Tests

- Run the default suite:
  `make test`.
- Run `tests/test_gpu_args_cli.sh` explicitly after changing executable option
  parsing or multi-GPU placement. Invalid values and device/budget count
  mismatches must reach the shared GPU parser in all four binaries; an
  `unknown option` response from a binary that advertises the flag is a
  release blocker. On CUDA, also start `ds4-server` once with
  `--gpu-vram auto` and the intended `--gpu-devices` list and preserve the
  resolved layout line.
- Run the vector checks explicitly after any tokenizer, template, KV, kernel,
  quantization, or prompt-rendering change:
  `DS4_TEST_MODEL=/path/to/0731.gguf
  DS4_TEST_VECTOR_FILE=tests/test-vectors/flash-0731/official.vec
  ./ds4_test --logprob-vectors`
  and
  `DS4_TEST_MODEL=/path/to/0731.gguf
  DS4_TEST_LOCAL_GOLDEN_FILE=tests/test-vectors/flash-0731/local-golden.vec
  ./ds4_test --local-golden-vectors`.
- Run server tests when HTTP, SSE, prompt rendering, cache policy, or tool-call
  replay changed:
  `./ds4_test --server`.
- Run `./ds4-eval --self-test-extractors`.
- On Metal, run `make test-metal-command-memory` after command-buffer or copy
  changes. With API validation enabled, repeated compute/copy/flush batches
  must preserve their output and keep the CPU heap bounded after warmup.
  The target also checks row, session, speculative and large-prefill TP gates
  with ordered loopback exchanges; physical RDMA remains a separate test.
  Long model runs must not accumulate temporary driver objects per token;
  fixed KV and expert-cache budgets alone do not rule out this growth.

### Critical Input And Server Regression Pass

Run these checks after changing parsers, server generation, model loading,
distributed snapshots, caches, DSpark, or CUDA build rules. Keep the item
numbers in the QA report so omissions are visible.

1. Send malformed OpenAI, Responses, and Anthropic requests with repeated
   owned string or array fields under ASan. Each request must fail cleanly and
   a following valid request must still work. Run `./ds4_test --server` too.
2. Replay at least 4,096 assistant/tool-result pairs through the Responses and
   Anthropic validators. Validation must remain linear-time and preserve the
   same accepted and rejected histories as a short replay.
3. Feed a distributed worker a snapshot header whose declared lengths exceed
   the configured and protocol limits. It must reject the header before a
   large allocation or payload read, without growing RSS materially.
4. Run malformed safetensors and GGUF fixtures through the loader and
   `gguf-tools/deepseek4-quantize` under ASan and UBSan. Truncated files,
   impossible dimensions, and overflowing tensor sizes must be rejected.
5. With a checkpoint-matched DSpark drafter, compare temperature-zero output
   against a no-drafter run for 400 and 800 generated tokens. Record the first
   output difference, acceptance, direct commits, replay fallbacks, and decode
   speed. Byte identity is not required: DSpark commits the batched verifier
   state, whose floating-point operation order differs from one-token decode.
   Verifier errors, invalid text, or a material continuation-quality regression
   remain release blockers. Use `--dspark-strict` for the target-only control.
6. Exercise unterminated and twice-closed reasoning in streaming and
   non-streaming OpenAI, Responses, and Anthropic requests, with and without
   tools. Reasoning must never leak into answer content.
7. On real Blackwell hardware, build the CUDA targets for `sm_120` or `sm_120a`
   and for DGX Spark `sm_121`. Confirm the emitted architecture flags retain
   the architecture-specific feature suffix and run `make cuda-regression`.
8. Build with CUDA 12.8 or newer and require the CUDA translation units to
   compile warning-free, including the `FLT_MAX` users.
9. Force a conversation past the in-memory KV threshold, restore the same disk
   checkpoint twice, and confirm the checkpoint file remains present after
   both successful loads. Corrupt checkpoints must still be rejected.
10. Run `make dspark-verify-depth` with matching 0731 target and drafter files.
    Strict capture must skip layers without a compressor and compare every
    captured compressor layer. Repeat with the matching Vision Exp pair.
    The test also verifies a six-token seed-plus-draft block and restores each
    retained prefix, comparing compressor and index-cache row counts against
    ordinary decode. Short output comparisons alone can miss stale frontiers.
11. Send the same long GLM 5.2 prompt twice to one server session. The second
    request must report `cache_source: memory-rewind`, reuse through one token
    before the prompt boundary, and produce the same greedy output as a fresh
    session.
12. Run `./ds4_test --think-tool-recovery`, then repeat through all three HTTP
    APIs. A complete tool block inside unclosed reasoning must be recovered
    once, preceding prose must remain reasoning, and no synthetic continuation
    may be generated.
13. Run `./ds4_agent_test` under ASan with agent-cache strings whose declared
    lengths exceed the remaining file. Loading must fail without allocating
    the declared size, and a valid cache must still load.
14. Run the server parser tests under UBSan with `NaN`, positive infinity, and
    negative infinity where integer JSON fields are expected. Conversion must
    be defined and clamped, with no sanitizer report.

## 3. Official Continuation Quality Gates

These tests are release-blocking after tokenizer, template, KV-cache, attention,
MoE routing, quantization, logit, or model-graph changes.  They are
teacher-forced continuation checks against hosted-model output and API
top-logprob slices, so do not replace them with one sampled chat answer.

- Build the scorer:
  `make -C gguf-tools quality-score`.
- Run `make test-quality-api` and
  `python3 tests/test_glm_reference_render.py` after scorer or fixture changes.
- Match every Flash GGUF to the fixture captured from the same checkpoint.
  The current release checkpoint is 0731 and uses
  `tests/test-vectors/flash-0731/`; the older undated GGUF uses the preserved
  `tests/test-vectors/flash-pre-0731/` fixture. Never report a cross-checkpoint
  failure as a quality regression. New checkpoints require a new
  `flash-CHECKPOINT/` directory before release QA; do not replace an older
  fixture. Checkpoint-labelled GGUFs such as `-0731` must use the fixture with
  the same label.
- Run the tracked DeepSeek V4 Flash 0731 smoke vectors:
  `DS4_TEST_MODEL=/path/to/0731.gguf
  DS4_TEST_VECTOR_FILE=tests/test-vectors/flash-0731/official.vec
  ./ds4_test --logprob-vectors`.
  This covers short prompts and long-prompt attention cases. The runner defaults
  to this fixture, but release logs should keep the path explicit.
- Run the 100-case DeepSeek V4 Flash fixture for every released Flash GGUF:
  `gguf-tools/quality-testing/score_official /path/to/deepseek-v4-flash.gguf gguf-tools/quality-testing/data/flash/manifest.tsv /tmp/flash.tsv 4096`.
  This manifest is also for the 0731 checkpoint. A later checkpoint needs a
  separately named 100-case fixture and must not be scored against this one.
- Treat the native MXFP4 Flash GGUF as a separate release artifact. Run the
  same 100-case fixture on Metal, resident CUDA, and CUDA SSD streaming when
  those backends are advertised; compare each result with the Metal baseline.
  For resident multi-GPU CUDA, pass the normal placement flags to the scorer,
  for example `--gpu-vram auto --gpu-devices 0,2,4,6,1,3,5,7
  --cuda-tensor-parallel`.
- Run the 100-case GLM 5.2 OpenRouter fixture for every released GLM GGUF:
  `gguf-tools/quality-testing/score_official models/GLM-5.2-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf gguf-tools/quality-testing/data/glm52-openrouter-100/manifest.tsv /tmp/glm52-q4.tsv 4096`.
  Current Q4 XL reference band: first-token match `95/100`, API top-1 agreement
  about `0.942`, and API pair-order agreement about `0.880`.
- Run the 100-case GLM 5.3 Flash fixture separately for both release artifacts:
  `gguf-tools/quality-testing/score_official /path/to/GLM-5.3-Flash-Q2.gguf gguf-tools/quality-testing/data/glm53-flash-openrouter-zai-fp8-100/manifest.tsv /tmp/glm53-q2.tsv 4096`
  and repeat with `GLM-5.3-Flash-Q4_K.gguf`. The current Q2 reference is
  average NLL `0.458030488`, first-token match `89/100`, and average greedy
  prefix `7.37`; Q4 is `0.299917952`, `90/100`, and `9.66`. These are fresh
  GLM-5.3 Z.AI FP8 continuations and must not be replaced by GLM 5.2 fixtures.
  The Q4 layout with Q8 KDA projections, embedding, and output head scored
  `0.300804038`, `90/100`, and `9.48` on M3 Ultra. Its paired BF16-layout
  control scored `0.300477636`, `90/100`, and `9.48`; the Q8 layout won 54 of
  100 cases despite its `0.109%` higher aggregate NLL.
- For GLM 5.3 attention changes, also run the eight long Z.AI FP8 cases.
  First run `python3 gguf-tools/quality-testing/render_glm_references.py
  gguf-tools/quality-testing/data/glm53-flash-openrouter-zai-fp8-long`, then
  score its `manifest-rendered.tsv` at context 8192 with `--rendered-prompt`.
  This preserves the official low-effort template and returned reasoning
  before scoring the answer. Every prompt crosses the 2,051-token boundary.
  Compare the default path against the scalar control on the same fixture.
  Z.AI supplies no output logprobs; do not report zero logprob-error columns
  as API parity. The historical 100-case numbers above use a no-thinking
  prefix and are not directly comparable to rendered-prefix scores.
- Run the same GLM fixture for reduced-precision GLM release files.  The Q2
  routed reference is lower quality but should stay near first-token match
  `92/100`, API top-1 agreement about `0.890`, and API pair-order agreement
  about `0.800` unless the quantization changed deliberately.
- Match every PRO GGUF to its checkpoint. The June preview uses
  `gguf-tools/quality-testing/data/pro/manifest.tsv`; the August 0813 release
  uses `gguf-tools/quality-testing/data/pro-0813/manifest.tsv`. Never interpret
  a cross-checkpoint score as a quantization result.
- Run the 100-case DeepSeek V4 PRO 0813 fixture for the new release GGUF:
  `gguf-tools/quality-testing/score_official /path/to/deepseek-v4-pro-0813.gguf gguf-tools/quality-testing/data/pro-0813/manifest.tsv /tmp/pro-0813.tsv 4096 --ssd-streaming`.
- For SSD streaming, run the same official-continuation scorer once with full
  residency and once with `--ssd-streaming` for the release model.  The summary
  and API agreement should stay in the same quality band.
- Compare any candidate against the previous release or last-known-good output:
  `python3 gguf-tools/quality-testing/compare_scores.py /tmp/old.tsv /tmp/new.tsv`.
  Treat a large first-token-match drop, a clear NLL regression, or a material
  API top-1/pair-order regression as a blocker unless the release notes call out
  an intentional quality tradeoff.
- Keep the raw `summary` and `api_summary` lines in the release notes or QA log.
  Do not use stale manifests from `misc/` as release evidence.

## 4. Metal Flash Path

Use the normal Flash GGUF that 128 GB users run.

- One-shot CLI:
  `./ds4 -m ds4flash.gguf --ctx 32768 --nothink -p "Explain C pointers in one paragraph."`
- Thinking and max-thinking prompts:
  run one short coding prompt with default thinking and one with max thinking.
- Long-context recall:
  run the long name/number or archive recall test used for catching attention
  and MoE routing drift.
- Logprob sanity:
  `./ds4 --nothink --temp 0 --dump-logprobs /tmp/ds4-logprobs.json --logprobs-top-k 20 -p "..."`
  and inspect that the continuation is sane.
- Speed sanity:
  run `ds4-bench` with `speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt` and compare prefill,
  generation speed, and KV bytes with the last known good numbers for the same
  machine.
- For native MXFP4 changes, run `make mxfp4-dot-test test-mxfp4-metal`, then a
  short greedy prompt and the section 3 continuation fixture with the MXFP4
  GGUF. The synthetic fused-MoE test and full-model quality gate must both pass.

### DSpark / DeepSpec Runtime

DSpark is opt-in, but it mutates the verifier, target-hidden capture, support
model loading, and scheduler paths.  Run these whenever DSpark support,
speculative verification, confidence/scheduler policy, target hidden capture,
tiny routed-MoE verifier kernels, or shared `--mtp-model` support-model code changes:

Use the 0731 DSpark support GGUF only with a Flash 0731 target. A support model
from another checkpoint can have plausible acceptance statistics while
producing a different greedy continuation.

Normal DSpark runs commit accepted target-verifier state directly. The batched
verifier and one-token decode use the same graph with different floating-point
operation order, so `output_match=0` against the baseline is diagnostic rather
than a failure. `--dspark-strict` remains the byte-identical target-only mode.

- Default greedy acceptance fixture:
  `DS4_DSPARK_MODEL=/Users/antirez/ds4/gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-IQ2XXS-w2Q2K-AProjQ8-SExpQ8-OutQ8-chat-v2-imatrix-0731.gguf DS4_DSPARK_SUPPORT=/Users/antirez/ds4/gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark-support-0731.gguf make dspark-acceptance`.
- 64-token guardrail:
  `DS4_DSPARK_FIXTURE_TOKENS=64 DS4_DSPARK_MODEL=/Users/antirez/ds4/gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-IQ2XXS-w2Q2K-AProjQ8-SExpQ8-OutQ8-chat-v2-imatrix-0731.gguf DS4_DSPARK_SUPPORT=/Users/antirez/ds4/gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark-support-0731.gguf make dspark-acceptance`.
- Opportunistic sampled acceptance fixture:
  `DS4_DSPARK_FIXTURE_TEMPERATURE=1 DS4_DSPARK_FIXTURE_TOP_P=0.95 DS4_DSPARK_FIXTURE_MIN_P=0.05 DS4_DSPARK_FIXTURE_SEED=12345 DS4_DSPARK_FIXTURE_TOKENS=32 DS4_DSPARK_MODEL=/Users/antirez/ds4/gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-IQ2XXS-w2Q2K-AProjQ8-SExpQ8-OutQ8-chat-v2-imatrix-0731.gguf DS4_DSPARK_SUPPORT=/Users/antirez/ds4/gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark-support-0731.gguf make dspark-acceptance`.
  Require proposals, a direct commit, and zero errors. Output identity with the
  baseline is not expected: normally evaluated boundary tokens are sampled,
  while verified DFlash/target greedy matches are committed without sampling.
- Exact sampled acceptance fixture:
  repeat the command above with `DS4_DSPARK_FIXTURE_EXACT_SAMPLING=1`.
  This mode must preserve the requested target distribution. Seeded output
  identity is not expected because speculative accept/reject decisions consume
  additional random numbers.
- `make test` includes a 100,000-draw distribution check for general `p/q`
  correction and for the point-mass DFlash proposal used at runtime. Both
  histograms must remain within the stated tolerance of the target
  distribution.
- Fixed-block direct partial commit:
  `DS4_DSPARK_FIXTURE_CONFIDENCE=0 DS4_DSPARK_FIXTURE_TOKENS=8 DS4_DSPARK_FIXTURE_REQUIRE_PARTIAL=1 DS4_DSPARK_MODEL=/Users/antirez/ds4/gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-IQ2XXS-w2Q2K-AProjQ8-SExpQ8-OutQ8-chat-v2-imatrix-0731.gguf DS4_DSPARK_SUPPORT=/Users/antirez/ds4/gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark-support-0731.gguf make dspark-acceptance`.
- DSpark verifier invariant smoke:
  `DS4_TEST_MODEL=/Users/antirez/ds4/gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-IQ2XXS-w2Q2K-AProjQ8-SExpQ8-OutQ8-chat-v2-imatrix-0731.gguf DS4_DSPARK_SUPPORT=/Users/antirez/ds4/gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark-support-0731.gguf make dspark-verify-depth`.
- If shared support-model or verifier structures changed, also run legacy MTP:
  `make mtp-verify-depth` with `DS4_TEST_MTP` set to a one-stage MTP support
  GGUF, or confirm the target skips only because the optional file is missing.
- Record `c_add` `accepted_draft`, `direct_full`, `direct_partial`,
  `replay_fallbacks`, `errors=0`, `verify_layer`, `net_saved`, and
  `output_match` for both 32-token and 64-token runs. At least one direct commit
  must occur. A faster run with lower proposal quality is a regression unless
  it was an intentional scheduler change.
- If verifier MoE kernels changed, run one diagnostic `c_add` profile with
  `DS4_DSPARK_VERIFY_SELECTED_PROFILE=1` or the Metal MoE stage profiler and
  record the selected-expert footprint or stage timing in the DSpark log.
- On Metal, benchmark at least one predictable code continuation and one
  deliberately unpredictable prose continuation at temperature 1. For the
  128-token M5 Max hash-table prompt, ordinary sampling measured
  41.71/44.49/44.73 t/s and opportunistic DSpark measured
  47.15/49.08/48.19 t/s, a median gain of about 8.3%. A surreal-prose control
  measured 44.46 t/s ordinary and 41.66 t/s opportunistic. DSpark remains
  opt-in because prompts with little useful speculation can still be slower.

### Session Microbatching And Metal TP

Run these gates whenever session scheduling, batched decode, mixed
prefill/decode, QKV projection, shared or routed experts, tensor parallelism,
or backend fallback selection changes.

- On a single Metal machine, run the full-vocabulary exact-logit oracle with
  2, 4, 8, and 16 sessions:
  `DS4_TEST_MODEL=/path/to/ds4flash.gguf DS4_TEST_SESSION_COUNT=N make test-metal-session-batch`.
  Compatible resident Q8 runs must report `native_shared=1 native_qkv=1` at
  every tested count. The 16-session run covers row counts above the old
  artificial eight-row limit.
- Repeat the four-session oracle with
  `DS4_METAL_SESSION_BATCH_SHARED=0` and with
  `DS4_METAL_SESSION_BATCH_QKV=0`. The first run must use the complete fallback;
  the second may batch the shared expert only. Both must remain bit-exact.
- The oracle must cover reversed row ordering, at least six decode steps, and a
  mixed prefill/decode call. Any nonzero differing-logit count is a blocker
  unless the model-specific section below declares a measured full-logit
  tolerance; argmax-only agreement is insufficient. When
  `DS4_TEST_LIVE_CONTROLS=1` is used, its interleaved serial evaluations are a
  correctness stress and must remain excluded from the reported batch timing.
- Benchmark 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 simultaneous resident sessions on the same host
  and model. Record model-step latency and aggregate decode tokens/second, not
  only request completion speed. The current Metal path batches QKV and part of
  the shared expert, but still runs attention, routed experts, shared down, and
  the output head per session. Treat flat aggregate scaling as unfinished
  implementation work, not evidence that Metal cannot benefit from batching.
- On `mac-m5max-it` and `mac-m5max-us`, run the same oracle in physical TP mode
  over explicit `tcp` and `rdma` transports. Set `DS4_TEST_TP_MODE=leader` on
  the leader and `DS4_TEST_TP_MODE=worker DS4_TEST_TP_LEADER_HOST=HOST` on the
  worker, with a unique `DS4_TEST_TP_PORT`. Run at least 2 and 4 sessions and
  preserve both logs. GLM 5.3 uses native row batching through token 2051 in TP
  too; its model-specific tolerance applies. Other unsupported TP shapes must
  select their established ordered fallback.
- For the current TB5 MacBook link, US is `10.99.0.2` on `en1`/`rdma_en1` and
  IT is `10.99.0.1` on `en6`/`rdma_en6`; both use GID index 1. Before testing,
  require `rdma_ctl status` to report `enabled` and `ibv_devinfo -v` to show
  `PORT_ACTIVE` plus the corresponding `::ffff:10.99.0.x` GID. Force the
  device and GID with `--rdma-device NAME --rdma-gid-index 1` if automatic
  selection is ambiguous. A working TB IP ping alone is not RDMA evidence.
- Kill the TP worker during one batch with `DS4_TEST_TP_DISCONNECT=1` on the
  leader. The operation must fail cleanly, invalidate every affected session,
  and return control without hanging. When remote control latency exceeds the
  default one-second marker window, set
  `DS4_TEST_TP_DISCONNECT_DELAY_MS=10000` and signal the worker as soon as
  `TP_DISCONNECT_READY` appears. Repeat over TCP and RDMA by sending `SIGSTOP`
  to the exact worker PID at that marker, then resume it after the leader
  returns. Startup must report the default `gate-timeout=750ms`; both paused
  runs must fail the gate and invalidate all affected sessions without a Metal
  GPU watchdog error. Before accepting that deadline, run one normal
  GLM-5.3 batch over each transport and one GLM-5.2 IQ2 RDMA prompt using the
  larger 108 GiB shard. `DS4_TP_GATE_TIMEOUT_MS` is a diagnostic override, not
  a setting required for normal inference.
- Set `DS4_TEST_TP_IDENTITY_MISMATCH=1` on the test leader once and require both
  ranks to reject the hello before inference. Also reflect a leader hello from
  a test peer without changing its role; the leader must reject two peers that
  both claim the coordinator rank. Separately point a worker at an unused port
  with `DS4_TP_TIMEOUT_SEC=1`; it must return a connection error rather than
  retrying indefinitely.
- Verify unsupported combinations explicitly. GLM 5.2, GLM 5.3 after the
  2,051-token dense-attention limit, DSpark support models, quality/reference modes,
  and CPU-router modes must use their established exact fallback or reject the
  combination before evaluation. GLM 5.3 below the boundary, including
  directional steering, and supported SSD-streaming configurations have native
  batching and must pass their model-specific oracle instead of being forced
  off.

## 5. Metal PRO Path

PRO support is experimental, but release builds must not break it silently.

- If a PRO-capable machine is available, run a short PRO q2 prompt and verify
  the correct template, thinking behavior, and endpoint aliases.
- For PRO Q4 distributed builds, test only on the intended high-memory machines.
- If PRO cannot be run locally, at least build all binaries and review changes
  touching model shape, tensor lookup, routed expert mapping, template logic,
  and KV payload compatibility.

## 6. GLM 5.2 And GLM 5.3

GLM has a different template, model shape, MTP block, attention layout,
tensor-parallel gate width, and streaming policy. Flash or PRO success does not
substitute for this matrix.

- On a 512 GB Metal machine, run short greedy prompts with both the Q4 XL and
  reduced-precision Q2 release GGUFs. Cover thinking and no-thinking templates,
  and verify the server reports the GLM model family rather than a DeepSeek
  alias internally.
- Run the OpenRouter smoke vectors explicitly:
  `DS4_TEST_MODEL=/path/to/glm.gguf
  DS4_TEST_VECTOR_FILE=tests/test-vectors/glm-openrouter/official.vec
  ./ds4_test --logprob-vectors`.
  Preserve the report as a diagnostic. The hosted vectors include very
  low-probability top-20 tails whose membership is not stable after GLM routed
  expert quantization, so an individual `official top token missing locally`
  assertion is not by itself a release blocker. Selected-token mismatches must
  remain consistent with the model's 100-case first-token band, and the
  section 3 scorer is the release gate for aggregate GLM quality.
- Run the 100-case Q4 XL and Q2 official fixtures from section 3 and preserve
  both `summary` and `api_summary` lines. Compare against the documented Q4 and
  Q2 reference bands independently.
- Run `tests/glm_long_context_smoke.sh` with the release-advertised context on
  the 512 GB Metal host. The generated continuation must begin with `>` and
  contain none of the known token-corruption markers.
- Exercise integrated GLM MTP with `--mtp-timing` on a deterministic
  prompt. Compare the greedy text to
  a non-MTP run, require clean speculative cycles, and record acceptance and
  timing. Also run once with MTP disabled to prove ordinary decode remains the
  default.
- Run the Metal session oracle with 2 and 4 GLM 5.2 sessions. It must report
  `family=glm native_shared=0 native_qkv=0` and remain exact, including mixed
  prefill/decode; the DeepSeek-only row-grid kernels must not activate.
- Run resident and SSD-streaming GLM Q2 prompts with the same greedy input.
  Compare first token and top-logprob sanity, and record the selected full-layer
  prefix and dynamic expert-cache budget.
- Run physical two-machine GLM TP over TCP and RDMA with short and long prompts.
  Record prefill/decode speed, transport, rank residency, and clean shutdown.
  The long prompt must cross the 2,048-token indexed-attention boundary. After
  changes to split attention, score at least 100 teacher-forced tokens beyond
  that boundary against the unsplit reference and run the 100-case Q2 fixture
  once through physical TP, preserving its `summary` and `api_summary` lines.
  Repeat one run with `--tensor-parallel-token-prefill` as the exact-arithmetic
  diagnostic. Test both Q2 and Q4 routed-expert files whose types have
  ownership-aware GLM TP kernels. Each rank must map only its owned experts and
  match the accepted single-host graph. A routed type without ownership-aware
  kernels must still reject clearly before evaluation rather than loading a
  partial split or hanging.
  The released GLM 5.2 IQ2_XXS file keeps `indexer.proj.weight` in FP32. Its
  loader and Metal graph must accept that established layout; GLM 5.3 may use
  its quantized or BF16 indexer projection instead. A short exact-output smoke
  on the current two-M5 RDMA setup returned `GLM52_OK` with 108.63 GiB planned
  per rank.
- With explicit permission for the current QA pass, run one resident GLM Q2
  prompt, a long-context prompt, integrated GLM MTP, and concurrent server
  requests on the eight-GPU CUDA host. Use ordinary eight-GPU layer placement
  for GLM; do not pass the Flash-specific
  `--cuda-tensor-parallel` option. Multi-tier GLM prefill must
  report progress through the tier-switching token-major path, and decode,
  cache updates, and output-head/logit assembly must complete without CPU spill.
  Auto-placement must reserve each layer's compact DSA/indexer cache and the
  graph workspace before loading weights; a late graph-allocation failure is a
  release blocker. Confirm the long-context layout stays within every device's
  budget and uses additional tiers when the cache no longer fits on the earlier
  ones.
  The long-context harness can select this backend with
  `DS4_GLM_BACKEND=cuda` and pass placement flags through
  `DS4_GLM_EXTRA_ARGS="--gpu-vram auto --gpu-devices 0,2,4,6,1,3,5,7"`.
- Through `ds4-server`, exercise OpenAI chat, Responses, and Anthropic requests
  against GLM, including thinking and SSE. DeepSeek compatibility endpoint
  aliases may resolve to the loaded model, but rendered prompts and generated
  text must use the GLM template.
- Compare a non-tool prompt and a complete assistant tool-call/tool-result
  transition against the model's `chat_template.jinja` byte for byte. Include
  reasoning effort, a client system message, a function description and JSON
  schema, assistant reasoning, and an observation. Token-count agreement alone
  is insufficient. The fixed one-tool fixture is 901 bytes with SHA-256
  `f1718f3ebb1c41532bcd5eedd9ebd5c84ae930b018e31962d8743efdbc5affc3`.
  Run `./ds4_test --server` as the model-free regression for the same exact
  schema instructions and transition delimiters.

### GLM 5.3 Flash

GLM 5.3 adds mHC, recurrent KDA, a pool-4 DSA indexer, and a different MTP
block. A GLM 5.2 pass does not cover these paths.

- Run the section 3 GLM 5.3 Q2 and Q4 100-case fixtures before and after any
  graph, quantization, attention, KDA, mHC, TP, or cache change.
- Build and run the focused primitive test:
  `make tests/test_glm53_kda && ./tests/test_glm53_kda`.
  It covers BF16 projections, pool-4 state construction and expansion, grouped
  scorer arithmetic and causal visibility, recurrent KDA prefill versus
  sequential decode, and exact repeated causal-attention output on ROCm.
- Run `make test-glm-attention` on Metal and CUDA, or
  `make test-glm-attention-rocm` on ROCm. Check FP16/FP32 padded selections,
  entirely empty selections, continued causal attention, and normalization
  against the independent numerical references. A bug in shared code or a
  copied kernel must be fixed and tested in every affected backend, including
  DeepSeek paths when affected.
- Treat session construction as the attention-memory admission point. Every
  owned DSA cache and indexer pool/tail, every KDA recurrent state, and the
  complete supported prefill workspace must allocate before a request is
  accepted. A first prefill must not grow a per-layer cache. Check both a
  4,096-token session and a long session in the memory report.
- Keep GLM-5.3 in absorbed MLA form. The model selects 2,048 tokens from
  complete four-token pools, plus the incomplete tail (at most three tokens).
  Dense attention is equivalent through 2,051 visible tokens; at 2,052 it
  must use the selector. This boundary must not depend on context allocation,
  SSD streaming, backend, or prefill chunk size. Padding IDs must be masked,
  including in batched prefill. Do not restore the 2.75 GiB expanded per-head
  K/V cache as a presumed quality fix.
  The complete Q2 fixture on the compact Metal graph scored NLL `0.458177271`,
  first-token agreement `90/100`, and average greedy prefix `7.390`, matching
  the accepted release band. Fresh Z.AI FP8 long-context controls also favored
  compact attention: weighted NLL was `0.539823254` versus `0.820997888` for
  expanded K/V over 24 synthetic cases, and `0.808160860` versus `0.820309487`
  over 12 natural source-context cases. These historical measurements used
  the old 4K cutoff; they are not evidence that it matches the reference graph.
- At 100K on an M5 Max, require the compact Q2 plan to remain near 94.09 GiB:
  89.87 GiB model, 1.11 GiB compact history, and 3.11 GiB fixed graph buffers.
  An 8,192-token one-shot control on the same graph reached 479.09 prefill and
  29.89 steady decode t/s. Repeat the continuation fixture after changing the
  compact cache type, absorbed projections, FlashAttention staging, or the
  crossover; numerical similarity to the old expanded graph is not the gate.
- On this 128 GB M3 Max, run the resident Q2 through the generic non-NAX Metal
  path. Repeat the 2,048-2,052 and 4,096-4,100 boundaries, official-continuation,
  MTP, snapshot, server-session, and continued-prefill gates used on M5. Record the different
  M3 performance floor rather than borrowing the M5 result. Run Q4 only with a
  bounded SSD-streaming cache; never try to make it fully resident.
- On one M5 Max, run resident Q2 with a prompt whose actionable instruction
  begins after token 4096. The model must recover the tail instruction and
  complete a tool or exact-output task. A short coherent continuation at token
  4109 is not sufficient: it previously missed a broken sparse selector.
- Run physical Q4 50/50 TP over the explicit TB5 RDMA devices. Graduate context
  allocation through 10K, 25K, and 50K, checking both ranks before advancing.
  The original 50K Q4 run reported 102.20 GiB per rank. Correct accounting for
  the dynamically allocated mHC/KDA prefill workspace adds about 0.44 GiB, so
  the expected plan is about 102.64 GiB per rank; record the exact new value on
  the next run. It remains below the fixed 110 GiB ceiling. Swap must not grow
  from idle, SSH must stay responsive, and both roles must exit cleanly.
- The 25K gate must place a read/edit/test task after a long inert archive and
  include one harmless tool failure that the agent must recover from. The 50K
  gate must contain at least 30K live prompt tokens and a real source repair:
  reproduce a failing test, edit the implementation without weakening tests,
  and pass a warning-strict build. Inspect the resulting diff manually.
- Confirm the logs select `rdma_en1` with GID 1 on US and `rdma_en6` with GID 1
  on IT. A TCP fallback does not satisfy this gate. Keep Q2 and Q4 in
  `~/ds4/gguf` on both hosts after testing.
- Run ordinary greedy decode, opportunistic MTP, and `--mtp-exact-sampling`.
  Greedy MTP must preserve the accepted continuation and provide a measured
  gain; the current short Q2 control improved from 34.21 to 41.97 t/s.
- After directional-steering changes, verify that a zero `45 x 4096` GLM vector
  is output-identical to the unsteered CLI for both FFN and attention hooks. A
  46-row file must be rejected with the expected 737,280-byte size. Build a
  `/path/to/glm53-direction.f32` test vector with the command in
  `dir-steering/README.md`, then run it through ordinary decode, `--mtp`, and a
  two-session `ds4-server` smoke. Run the native batch oracle with:

  ```sh
  DS4_TEST_MODEL=/path/to/GLM-5.3-Flash-Q2.gguf \
  DS4_TEST_SESSION_COUNT=4 DS4_TEST_LOGIT_TOLERANCE=0.001 \
  DS4_TEST_DIRECTIONAL_STEERING_FILE=/path/to/glm53-direction.f32 \
  DS4_TEST_DIRECTIONAL_STEERING_FFN=1 \
  DS4_TEST_DIRECTIONAL_STEERING_ATTN=0.25 \
  make test-metal-session-batch
  ```

  It must cover native decode and mixed prefill/decode without changing any
  selected token. Repeat a short physical TP run over RDMA with the same file
  and scales on both ranks. On CUDA and ROCm release targets, require a
  warning-free build and one short steered GLM 5.3 Q2 prompt. Finally rerun a
  held-out target/control sweep; an effective edit that makes control answers
  repetitive or incoherent does not pass.
- Run the two- and four-session GLM 5.3 server oracle below token 2052 on one
  M5 and physical TP. For both native single-M5 and TP paths, set
  `DS4_TEST_LOGIT_TOLERANCE=0.001`: row-batched reductions may differ from the
  serial launch order, but every selected token must match and the maximum
  full-logit delta must remain below that bound. Also run the serial rollback
  with zero tolerance. The current four- and eight-session Q2 maxima are both
  `0.0001297`; the current six-step two-session RDMA maximum is `0.000175238`. Past
  2051, require the exact ordered fallback until a sparse native batch oracle
  proves full-vocabulary correctness.
- Exercise every pool remainder at the dense-to-sparse boundary with prompts
  ending at tokens 2048 through 2056, then repeat 4096 through 4100 for the
  prefill-work boundary. The sparse cases must retain the same greedy token,
  contain no nonfinite logits, and pass a multi-token exact-output task. Small
  batched-reduction logit differences are acceptable only when the official
  continuation and long-task gates remain in band. Build each prompt against
  `--dump-tokens`; word counts are not a valid substitute for rendered-token
  counts. The current `.180` CUDA reference returned exactly `BOUNDARY_OK` at
  all five frontiers.
- Run the session snapshot test across the sparse boundary:
  `DS4_TEST_MODEL=/path/to/GLM-5.3-Flash-Q2.gguf
  DS4_TEST_SNAPSHOT_PROMPT=/path/to/a-4k-plus-prompt.txt
  DS4_TEST_SNAPSHOT_CTX=8192 ./ds4_test --session-snapshot`.
  Restored top logits before and after one continued token must match the
  uninterrupted session within the test's `1e-6` tolerance.
- Repeat that command with `DS4_TEST_GLM_MTP=1`. The test must replay 16
  integrated-MTP cycles across the snapshot, including both one- and two-token
  outcomes, and match every committed token plus the final top-eight logits.
  The M5 Max reference produced 10 one-token cycles, 6 two-token cycles, and
  22 committed tokens without a verifier failure. It then synced back to the
  original long prompt, reproduced its top-eight logits within `1e-6`, and
  completed four more MTP cycles. The current `.180` CUDA run produced 5
  one-token and 11 two-token outcomes, committed 27 tokens, and also passed.
- Measure continued prefill as actual appends to one live session, not only as
  a single cold prompt. On an M5 Max, run:
  `./ds4-bench -m /path/to/GLM-5.3-Flash-Q2.gguf --metal
  --prompt-file /path/to/a-25k-prompt.txt --ctx-start 4096 --ctx-max 12288
  --ctx-alloc 16384 --step-incr 2048 --gen-tokens 0 --csv /tmp/glm53.csv`.
  The current 2K append results are 452.56, 423.74, 409.79, and 396.72 t/s at
  4K, 6K, 8K, and 10K resident prefixes. A warmed first append below 350 t/s
  requires investigation. The serial rollback control measured 29.68 t/s.
  On `.180` CUDA, the current 4K, 6K, and 8K append results are 522.66, 506.20,
  and 502.50 t/s.
- Keep the 33987-token Q4 TP agent run as the final long-state gate. The old
  serial sparse path took about 24 minutes to reach its first tool call. The
  batched path processed a 34023-token initial suffix in 109.846 seconds
  (309.74 t/s), completed the full read/edit/test task in 178.93 seconds, and
  used explicit RDMA. A faster result must still pass the tail task, fixture
  inspection, and official-continuation gates.
- On one DGX Spark, run Q2 through CUDA and repeat the primitive, official
  continuation, 4,096-4,100 boundary, continued-prefill, snapshot, MTP, server,
  and coding-agent gates. Validate independently on `.180` and `.181`; they are
  separate single-host runs, not CUDA TP. Q4 and Spark-to-Spark RDMA are not
  supported in this pass. The accepted `.180` 100-case reference is average
  NLL `0.461783551`, first-token agreement `90/100`, and average greedy prefix
  `7.49`.
- For the default compact CUDA graph, dump the complete first-token logits at
  a 1,024-token frontier twice with the same context allocation. Both files
  must be byte-identical. Run the 100-case GLM-5.3 fixture from the same linked
  objects, then run the two-session single-GPU oracle with
  `DS4_TEST_CUDA_SINGLE_GPU=1 DS4_TEST_SESSION_COUNT=2`. Require
  `nonexact_logits=0`. Finally run the fused D2R kernels under CUDA memcheck;
  an argmax-only comparison or coherent text does not replace these gates.

### GLM 5.3 Vision

Vision is a separate sidecar on Metal, single-GPU CUDA, and ROCm, and has its
own release gate. Text-only GLM success does not exercise image preprocessing,
the vision graph, multimodal prompt spans, or image-aware KV identity.

- Download `glm53-vision` and verify
  `GLM-5.3-Flash-Vision-Encoder.gguf` has SHA-256
  `ae23e14c6979e889051b2e4a39351abcdafb161e18e606fae4d8c40095a4bf3a`.
- Build `tests/test_glm53_vision_engine` and
  `tests/test_glm53_vision_prompt`. Run them with the release Q2 text GGUF, the
  vision sidecar, and a fixed PNG. Set `DS4_TEST_VISION_REPEATS=3` for the
  encoder test to require finite, repeatable embeddings. Run
  `python3 tests/test_compare_glm53_vision_embeddings.py` to check that the
  comparison rejects invalid reference embeddings as well as invalid candidates.
  The prompt test must generate a visual answer, reuse an unchanged image
  without repeated prefill, and rebuild when
  only the image fingerprint changes. It must also hold image-token positions
  fixed, replace the visual embedding with zeros, and observe changed output
  logits. Use a 4,096-token test session so a large screenshot plus the output
  cannot hit the old 2,048-token test ceiling. After explicit session
  invalidation, and again after restoring the zeroed embedding, require the
  complete image-conditioned logits to match the original within `1e-6`.
  This catches a compact-prefill path that processes placeholders but silently
  ignores the image data, as well as incomplete multimodal state rebuilds.
- Keep one accepted Metal embedding from a fixed image and compare CUDA and
  ROCm output with `tests/compare_glm53_vision_embeddings.py`. Require finite
  output, cosine similarity at least `0.995`, mean absolute error at most
  `0.001`, and maximum absolute error at most `0.06`. This permits normal BF16
  GEMM ordering differences but rejects a changed vision graph.
- Run a fixed model-level vision fixture containing photographs, screenshots,
  diagrams, readable text, spatial questions, and unrelated-image controls.
  Compare complete answers with the official GLM-5.3-Flash vision service and
  repeat through CLI, server, and `ds4-agent`. A valid decoder, expected image
  token count, or plausible but ungrounded prose does not pass this gate. With
  a local vision-enabled server running, require:

  ```sh
  python3 tests/run_glm53_vision_quality.py
  ```

  to report `6/6 passed`. For agent tests, expose only the raster fixtures;
  source SVGs or expected-answer files beside them let the agent bypass vision
  with text tools.
- Run the decoder over RGB, RGBA, grayscale, and palette PNG, baseline and
  progressive JPEG, EXIF orientation, truncated files, wrong CRCs, huge
  dimensions, and decompression-bomb fixtures under ASan and UBSan. Invalid
  files must fail without a sanitizer report or large allocation.
- In `./ds4`, submit one PNG and one JPEG with `/read`, then continue each chat
  with a text turn. Repeat once with `--mtp`; verification after image prefill
  must complete without a GLM MTP failure.
- In `ds4-agent`, require `view_image` to inspect a real file and use the
  resulting multimodal observation in a later read/edit/test tool loop. Image
  observations must enter as user-role multimodal turns; GLM loses grounding
  when several images are packed into a tool-response role. Run the five-image
  fixture in one turn so the prompt exceeds 4K, and require the same facts as
  the official Z.AI control. Text-only tool observations must remain tool-role.
- Through `ds4-server`, test OpenAI Chat data URIs, Responses `input_image`,
  and Anthropic base64 image blocks. Include two images in one message and an
  image in a later turn. Local paths, `file:` URLs, remote URLs, malformed
  base64, unsupported media, more than 16 images, and bodies over 64 MiB must
  return 4xx without reading local files or making network requests.
- Run Q4 across `mac-m5max-us` and `mac-m5max-it` over explicit TB5 RDMA with
  `--vision` on both ranks. The leader must encode once, both ranks must keep
  matching multimodal KV state, and the answer must remain correct. Record
  image encode, prefill, first-token, and decode timing separately.
- Build CPU, CUDA, and ROCm targets warning-free after vision changes. Run the
  encoder comparison, prompt replay test, and six-case server fixture on one
  DGX Spark and on `strixhalo`; ROCm Q2 must use bounded SSD streaming.

## 7. SSD Streaming

SSD streaming is a capacity path, so test both correctness and user experience.

- Flash q2/q2-q4 streaming:
  `./ds4 -m ds4flash.gguf --ssd-streaming --ssd-streaming-cache-experts 32GB -p "..."`
- Regression test mixed-quant Flash SSD streaming. Use the mixed q2/q4 GGUF
  with boosted Q4 routed-expert layers and a prompt long enough to exercise the
  selected-address prefill path; it must not fail with "model range is not
  covered by mapped model views":
  `./ds4 -m gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Layers37-42Q4KExperts-OtherExpertLayersIQ2XXSGateUp-Q2KDown-AProjQ8-SExpQ8-OutQ8-chat-v2-imatrix-fixed-0731.gguf --ssd-streaming --ssd-streaming-cache-experts 16GB --ctx 4096 --tokens 1 --nothink --prompt-file /tmp/ds4_600tok_prompt.txt`.
- Cold streaming measurement:
  run once with `--ssd-streaming-cold` and verify no deadlock, missing expert,
  or impossible slowdown.
- Confirm startup reports cache budget and that generation does not stall on
  repeated expert misses for a small interactive prompt.
- After changing model-map or memory accounting, test automatic sizing, an
  impossible large target such as `--ssd-streaming-cache-experts 500GB`, and
  `--ssd-streaming-cache-experts 1`. The large target must be reduced below
  the final memory-guard budget instead of failing or pressuring the machine
  into swap. The one-slot run must select direct per-layer reads and complete
  correctly without pretending that the selected-expert cache can hold one
  token's routed set. Preserve the startup lines showing the effective cache,
  global or per-layer decode map, and total planned memory.
- If streaming cache internals changed, test the same prompt twice and compare
  first-token/logprob sanity between runs.
- Cache and I/O optimizations must not change routed expert counts, weight
  precision or activation precision. With the same model and prefill chunks,
  require identical complete logits and deterministic output across cache
  policies. Test numerical-kernel changes separately against a reference.
- Run `MTL_DEBUG_LAYER=1 make test-metal-ssd-experts` on an idle Metal host.
  It exercises all eight routed slots through hits and evictions, requires byte-identical
  outputs with different cache capacities, and replaces more than 4,096
  layer mappings while retaining a separate auxiliary model mapping.
  For cached-batch changes, also run
  `MTL_DEBUG_LAYER=1 ./tests/test_metal_ssd_experts --full-glm-shape`.
  This uses full GLM's 6144/2048 expert dimensions, repeated batch sizes and
  evictions, and checks intermediate activations and output byte-for-byte.
  Include the 255/256/257-token dispatch boundary and an undersized cache.
  Repeat with `DS4_METAL_DISABLE_METAL4=1` to cover the conventional kernels.
- Run `MTL_DEBUG_LAYER=1 make test-glm-attention` and a real server coding
  session with validation enabled. Irregular context lengths must work, not
  just round benchmark sizes. Preserve validation failures and fix their cause;
  disabling validation is not a passing result.
- On Metal, compare the complete prefill logits with the previous executable
  at 2K/3K and 8K/12K frontiers, with generation and continued prefill between
  them. Exercise initial whole-layer reads, later selected-expert reads, cold
  caches and a mixed-size expert layer. Record initial and continued speed
  separately, including the first decode step rather than only steady speed.
  Save the exact commands and prompt files with each comparison. Equal context
  lengths do not imply equal input tokens. For short tool-result appends, test
  16, 43 and 114 tokens as well, followed by generation: a faster append must
  not merely move its I/O cost into the next decode steps.
- Deny the first static-weight `mlock` in a test build or interposer. Startup
  must leave those weights pageable and continue with correct output. Do not
  confuse this with denying every lock: the existing expert cache also needs
  locked buffers. Keep external memory monitoring enabled; do not deliberately
  trigger system OOM or a GPU watchdog reset.
- Run the section 12 coding-client and prefix-replay checks with a model
  larger than RAM and automatic SSD cache sizing, for both DeepSeek and GLM.
  A resident model pass does not exercise cache evictions after tool results.
- On an idle M5 Max, run the full GLM 5.3 Q2 SSD-streaming regression with the
  16 GiB expert budget. Use the release GGUF and verify its checksum before
  comparing results. The current reference file is
  `GLM-5.3-UD-IQ2_XXS_RoutedIQ2XXS_blk78Q2K.gguf`, SHA-256
  `059b36accd4c9acf73099da9f703b574d627869d619b7c4c316aa856e33d472e`.
  Discard one warm-up run, then take the median of three runs of each command:

  ```sh
  GLM_SSD_MODEL=/path/to/GLM-5.3-UD-IQ2_XXS_RoutedIQ2XXS_blk78Q2K.gguf

  ./ds4 -m "$GLM_SSD_MODEL" --ssd-streaming \
    --ssd-streaming-cache-experts 16GB --ctx 1024 --tokens 16 \
    --nothink --temp 0 --seed 1 \
    -p "$(head -c 2500 tests/test-vectors/glm-openrouter/prompts/long_memory_archive.txt)"

  ./ds4 -m "$GLM_SSD_MODEL" --ssd-streaming \
    --ssd-streaming-cache-experts 16GB --ctx 1024 --tokens 64 \
    --nothink --temp 0 --seed 1 \
    -p "Write the word apple exactly 100 times, separated by one space. Do not stop early and output nothing else."
  ```

  The first command must report 463 input tokens and keep median prefill at
  or above 11.3 t/s. It truncates the archive before its final question, so it
  is a timing input, not a sufficient quality test. Repeat with an explicit
  final question asking which component reports anomalies; require gamma. The
  second must emit all 64 requested output tokens and keep median generation at
  or above 5.5 t/s. The M5 Max reference medians are 12.59 and 6.14 t/s. Startup
  should plan about 39.63 GiB at this context, including 22.55 GiB of static
  model mapping, and initially restrict the model
  map to the token embedding. GLM must demand-fill its expert cache by default;
  an ordinary run and `--ssd-streaming-cold` should have comparable cache-miss
  counts and speed unless an explicit preload count or diagnostic cap is used.
  A memory guard or static decode map that accounts nearly the full 196.58 GiB
  GGUF, a Metal OOM, repeated garbage tokens, or a compact-attention result
  that omits the RoPE score is a release blocker.

  Also run `python3 tests/test_glm_rope_prefill.py --model "$GLM_SSD_MODEL"`
  under the external memory guard. This checks all next-token logits against
  the general attention path, then requires a correct answer to a complete
  question. Use the full, non-Flash checkpoint: Flash has no RoPE contribution
  and cannot catch this dispatch regression. `make test-glm-attention` covers
  nonzero RoPE against a double-precision reference with F16/F32 caches,
  initial and continued prefill, and incomplete head groups.

  Also test an 8K prompt followed by a 4K append at a 16K context with the
  automatic cache and an explicit cache target. This crosses compact-indexer
  warmup, which reads weights from earlier layers after prefill releases their
  mappings. Compare full logits and monitor memory throughout, not just startup.
  For `ds4-bench`, use `DS4_BENCH_FORCE_SNAPSHOT=1` when the extra snapshot fits;
  otherwise its large-payload fallback replays the prefix and changes the cache
  state before the append. Record which restoration method was used.

September 6 focused SSD pass, 128 GB M5 Max only: GLM 5.3 Flash Q4_K
(177.77 GiB) and DeepSeek Flash Vision Exp MXFP4 (145.26 GiB). Automatic
budgets and existing prefill chunk sizes were used, without speculation.
The following are three-run medians; the final GLM prefill variant was
repeated after the interleaved cache-policy comparison.

| Workload | Prefill before / after | Generation before / after |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| GLM, initial 2K, 128 output tokens | 111.73 / 121.28 t/s | 6.11 / 11.85 t/s |
| GLM, 1K append, 128 output tokens | 83.33 / 104.43 t/s | 7.11 / 14.89 t/s |
| DeepSeek, initial 8K, 64 output tokens | 285.12 / 296.59 t/s | 7.21 / 7.91 t/s |
| DeepSeek, 4K append, 64 output tokens | 257.07 / 259.44 t/s | 9.42 / 11.58 t/s |

All compared full logits were exact: GLM at 2K/3K and 8K/12K, DeepSeek at
8K/12K. Matching official-continuation subsets were also identical: GLM
24 cases, 2,963 tokens, NLL `0.309656938`; DeepSeek Vision Exp 12 cases,
768 tokens, NLL `0.163628345`. These are not complete 100-case quality passes.
Automatic, cold, one-slot and 500 GiB-hint GLM checks preserved exact logits.
The one-slot run was shortened after direct reads took about 31 seconds per
token. The oversized hint was safely reduced but decoded at only 0.36 t/s;
automatic sizing remains the practical default. Denying just the static lock
passed; denying all memory locks failed cleanly in the expert cache.

The initial full non-Flash GLM Q2 check exposed a pre-existing correctness
bug: compact dense prefill omitted its RoPE score. Flash has no RoPE score and
could not reveal it. The corrected dispatch passes the independent attention
oracle and a real-model comparison with the general attention path: all
154,880 logits match and the complete archive question returns gamma. This
is separate from the output-identical cache changes. No matching full GLM 5.3
official-continuation suite was available; do not use Flash vectors to sign
off that checkpoint.

Real Pi coding sessions passed with both larger-than-RAM Flash models above:
read, edit, write, warning-strict C builds, test execution, an intentional
missing-file error and recovery, then another edit/test round. Independent
exhaustive C oracles passed. The DeepSeek and GLM conversations reached
7,360 and 7,111 tokens; every tool-result continuation reused its full live
prefix. Pi's subsequent compaction requests correctly rebuilt shorter prompts.
Separate 4.6K-4.8K tool-history checks returned GREEN on replay and BLUE after
editing the tool result, matching a fresh server. These earlier-prefix replays
required rebuilds: GLM reported a 4,615-token match but rebuilt its recurrent
state in about 40 seconds; DeepSeek rebuilt the compressed history. Do not
count a reported matched prefix as saved computation without checking this log.
No OOM, GPU reset or memory-pressure termination occurred in the initial pass. It did not
test M3, CUDA, ROCm, physical TP, vision or speculative SSD decoding.

The follow-up retained a larger automatic DeepSeek cache (86.20 GiB on these
hosts), bounded preload priorities, and the correct aging clock for GLM's
first routed layer. A same-cache coding comparison reduced DeepSeek expert
read bytes from 94.65 to 78.18 GiB and raised initial generation from 18.49
to 19.83 t/s; continued generation was neutral at 24.62/24.55 t/s. These are
application read counts, not a measurement of physical SSD traffic.

Later single-run comparisons, with unchanged precision and prompt chunks:

| Workload | Prefill before / after | Generation before / after |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| DeepSeek MXFP4, 8K, 128 output tokens | 280.97 / 299.87 t/s | 10.42 / 11.90 t/s |
| DeepSeek MXFP4, 4K append, 128 output tokens | 261.40 / 263.32 t/s | 16.15 / 19.34 t/s |
| Full GLM Q2, 8K, 16 output tokens | 63.23 / 90.70 t/s | 2.93 / 3.69 t/s |
| Full GLM Q2, 4K append, 16 output tokens | 61.56 / 84.31 t/s | 3.85 / 3.96 t/s |

Full GLM used the same 35.36 GiB expert cache, 16K context, and snapshot
restoration in both runs. Its 512-token append also improved from 14.64 to
26.01 t/s with the larger cache. Every compared full logit at 8K/12K is exact;
Flash Q4's 2K/3K logits remain exact too. The earlier matching official subsets
remain unchanged after the DeepSeek cache-policy update.

Bounded Metal model views fix a separate memory problem: single spans used
to retain earlier layers. Two old-mapping/control runs with a 61.35 GiB cache
were stopped by the external guard for swap growth, without a reboot or GPU
reset. The corrected full-GLM 8K/12K run completed with no new swap and at
least 15.41 GiB available. It decoded 64 tokens at 5.79/5.94 t/s; that run
replayed the prefix before appending. At the smaller cache, the snapshot-based
comparison above improved minimum available memory from 11.11 to 27.87 GiB.
These successful runs do not erase the failed controls.

The final Flash Q4 MTP snapshot check passed at 3,778 prompt tokens: 16 replayed
cycles, 12 single-token and four double-token outcomes, identical committed
tokens and restored top logits, followed by four context-reuse cycles.
Its real Pi coding task passed again with automatic cache sizing and an
independent C oracle. Model-free frontend, agent, session-state, TP-command,
SSD-cache, attention and eight-expert eviction/mapping tests passed on M5.

Additional Metal API validation found two independent issues: managed-storage
notifications on shared buffers, and GLM attention scratch lengths that were
not multiples of 16 bytes. The notifications were removed and the scratch
allocations padded without changing the computed values. Irregular-length
attention tests pass against the numerical oracle with validation enabled.
Validated real Pi coding sessions now pass for Flash Q4 and DeepSeek Vision
Exp MXFP4, reaching 7.2K and 7.6K context with independent C oracles. Minimum
available memory was 13.21 and 7.40 GiB, respectively, with no swap growth.
The validated Flash MTP snapshot test also passes. These runs overlapped a
model download, so their elapsed times are not performance references.

Full GLM short-append cache checks used the code-audit prompt, 1,024 initial
tokens, an 8K allocation, a 66 GB cache hint (61.35 GiB effective), forced
snapshot restoration and 64 greedy output tokens at each frontier. The control
set `DS4_METAL_DISABLE_STREAMING_PREFILL_BATCH_SELECTED_ADDR=1`.
All 154,880 logits and complete generated text matched in every pair.

| Append | Time before / after | Generation afterward | Repetitions |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 16 tokens | 30.8 / 2.9 s | 4.09 / 5.11 t/s | Three-run medians |
| 43 tokens | 34.4 / 5.4 s | 4.00 / 5.34 t/s | One pair |
| 114 tokens | 34.9 / 8.7 s | 3.90 / 5.39 t/s | One pair |

The 16-token runs' initial prefill medians were 55.92/55.16 t/s and initial
generation 4.14/3.78 t/s; do not claim a general decode improvement from the
post-append result. No run grew swap or raised memory pressure; minimum
available memory across these runs was 15.05 GiB. These performance tests
ran after the model download and checksum verification had finished.

The full GLM Q2 Pi retry on IT passed with Metal API validation and automatic
cache sizing (69.51 GiB). It read the project, fixed the function, wrote tests,
corrected its own test expectation and case count, and passed both its 726-case
test and the independent C oracle. The session reached 8,416 tokens; ordinary
tool-result turns reused their complete live prefixes, while Pi's final
compaction correctly started a new 273-token prompt. The complete task took
795.58 seconds, with at least 11.40 GiB available and no swap growth or API
validation error. This is a workflow result, not a paired speed benchmark.
Full GLM's validated MTP snapshot check also passed at 3,778 prompt tokens:
16 replayed cycles committed the same 20 tokens and restored the same top
logits, followed by four context-reuse cycles. Minimum available memory was
15.01 GiB with the 61.35 GiB cache, without swap growth.
The final full-model 8K/12K snapshot regression preserved every logit from
the earlier reference. With the smaller 35.36 GiB cache it measured 94.81/91.08
t/s prefill and 3.62/3.81 t/s generation (16 tokens), with at least 27.88 GiB
available and no swap growth. The reference ran on the other M5, so this is
a correctness and memory regression check, not a new paired speed claim.

The earlier US full non-Flash GLM Pi task did NOT pass: after several successful
tool calls, a reader stalled inside `pread` near 5.2K context. The external
guard timed out. Kernel stacks later showed the terminated server still
waiting in APFS `cluster_read_ext`; an independent process could not even
open the same GGUF (`apfs_io_lock_exclusive`). Available memory recovered,
but killing the processes did not clear the filesystem wait. The cause is
not established. The IT coding pass does not resolve this US failure: clear
the filesystem wait and repeat the US test before signing off that host.
No reboot was performed without permission; an unrelated Claude session
was still running there.

## 8. CUDA / DGX Spark

Before a release, ask the user for CUDA access if it is not already configured.
Use either DGX Spark / GB10 host, `toor@192.168.4.180` or
`toor@192.168.4.181`. Do not claim CUDA is release-ready without this pass.

Both Sparks normally run vLLM. Before stopping it, record its process, service
or container, model, ports, and exact launch command. Confirm all vLLM workers
have exited before loading DwarfStar. At the end, stop every DwarfStar process,
restore the exact vLLM service, and verify its original ports and model health.
Do not use high-performance Hugging Face Xet mode while vLLM is resident.

- Fetch or push the exact release commit to the CUDA machine.
- Build:
  `make clean && make cuda-spark`.
- Require both the DGX Spark build and the eight-GPU CUDA build to complete
  without compiler warnings. The eight-GPU build is performed only after
  receiving explicit permission to use `192.168.60.250` for this QA pass.
- Run:
  `make cuda-regression`.
- After aligned Q8 scratch changes, run `make test-cuda-q8-scratch
  CUDA_ARCH=sm_121`, also under Compute Sanitizer. Dense and paired outputs
  must be exact with reused scratch, an undersized buffer, and captured graph
  replays after input changes. Include full-model prefill and decode logits;
  a short token comparison cannot detect stale scratch contents.
- After CUDA DSpark changes, run `make test-cuda-dspark-moe CUDA_ARCH=sm_121`
  and `compute-sanitizer --error-exitcode 1 tests/test_cuda_dspark_moe --check-only`.
  Cover one through eight rows, distinct/shared/partly overlapping experts,
  invalid negative selections, and Q2 down assignments spanning several launch
  tiles. Deduplicated gate/up rows must match separate one-token calls exactly.
  Run the Q8 scratch test too: every small batch must equal its separate rows.
  Repeat the section 4 greedy, opportunistic, exact-sampling and forced-partial
  fixtures with matching 0731 weights. CUDA retains all five intermediate
  prefixes of a six-token seed/draft block; ordinary partial accepts must not
  need replay. Keep the scheduler's seed count separate from successful drafts.
  Exercise a live speculative cache before and after continued prefill at
  2K, 4K and 8K frontiers. Also compare the official continuation scorer with
  `DS4_METAL_PREFILL_CHUNK=6` in both control and candidate builds: this shared
  diagnostic override exercises the small CUDA batches, unlike ordinary
  teacher-forced single-token scoring alone.
- For native MXFP4 changes, run
  `make test-mxfp4-cuda CUDA_ARCH=native` on the multi-GPU CUDA host only after
  receiving explicit permission for `192.168.60.250`, and
  `make test-mxfp4-cuda CUDA_ARCH=sm_121` on DGX Spark. Dense MMQ, routed MMQ,
  routed MMVQ, fused gate/up, and fused down must pass. The Spark run must also
  pass the Blackwell K-tile guard. This synthetic parity test does not replace
  full-model continuation scoring.
- With that permission, run the native MXFP4 GGUF resident on the multi-GPU
  host, and run it with `--ssd-streaming` on DGX Spark. Use the same greedy prompt and continuation
  fixture on both. Record prefill and generation speed, require finite logits,
  and compare quality with the Metal MXFP4 result. Blackwell MMQ quantizes
  activations to native FP4 for batched work; decode MMVQ keeps Q8 activations,
  so quality must be checked rather than inferred from kernel-only parity.
- Run a short CLI prompt with the Flash GGUF and record generation t/s.
- Run a longer prompt that exercises routed experts past a few thousand tokens.
- With explicit permission for this QA pass, run the full-vocabulary decode
  oracle on the eight-GPU CUDA host:
  `DS4_TEST_MODEL=/path/to/flash.gguf make test-cuda-session-batch`.
  Preserve the per-batch timing for 2, 4, and 8 rows and require
  `nonexact_logits=0`. Run the released Q4 file and the reduced-precision Q2
  file: Q4 exercises grouped routed/shared stages, while unsupported Q2 native
  MoE shapes must retain the ordered exact fallback.
- With CUDA TP attention enabled, compatible Q4 runs must use grouped
  attention-core, QKV, KV-store, and attention-post by default and remain
  full-vocabulary exact against isolated decode. On the eight-L40S host, the
  16-row decode step must remain above 110 aggregate tokens/s. Repeat once with
  `DS4_CUDA_TP_ATTN=0` only as rollback coverage; it is not the production
  configuration.
- Run native mixed prefill/decode at the default frontier and at compressed
  context:
  `DS4_TEST_MODEL=/path/to/flash.gguf make test-cuda-mixed-batch` and
  `DS4_TEST_CONTEXT=4096 DS4_TEST_MIXED_INITIAL=2048 DS4_TEST_MIXED_ROUNDS=8
  DS4_TEST_MODEL=/path/to/flash.gguf make test-cuda-mixed-batch`.
  Every round must report exact logits and `mode=native`; a serialized fallback
  is a failure for the eight-GPU TP/EP topology. Under CUDA TP attention, the
  native mixed step must use the same exact grouped decode stages when their
  capability checks pass; record correctness and speedup separately. Also
  force an 800-row prefill quantum with
  `DS4_TEST_ALLOW_FALLBACK=1`; it must report the serialized safety fallback.
- With explicit permission for the eight-GPU host, start `ds4-server` with 8
  and 16 batched sessions and issue at least that many simultaneous requests
  with mixed prompt lengths. Verify no session mix-up, deadlock, or starvation
  and record aggregate generation throughput.
- On DGX Spark, verify the same public batch API and server concurrency use the
  single-GPU fallback without creating peer-only TP/EP state. The eight-GPU
  native oracle is not a valid Spark test because its topology is intentionally
  unavailable there.
- For GLM 5.3, use the resident Q2 artifact only. Require the dedicated CUDA
  primitive and continuation gates in section 6, then record prefill,
  generation, MTP, continued-prefill, server aggregate throughput, and peak
  memory. Do not attempt the 178 GiB Q4 artifact on one 128 GB Spark.
- If CUDA Q4, distributed, streaming hooks, tensor span loading, or model cache
  code changed, test the specific GGUF and split mode that uses that path.
- Verify that any CUDA-only warning fixes are also clean on macOS and do not
  change Metal behavior.

## 9. ROCm / Strix Halo

Use the Strix Halo Framework Desktop via the VPN hostname `strixhalo`
(`antirez@strixhalo`).  This host validates the ROCm backend; do not use it as
a substitute for CUDA or Metal release testing.

- Fetch or push the exact release commit to the Strix Halo machine.
- Build:
  `make clean && make strix-halo`.
- Require the ROCm build to complete without compiler warnings.
- Run `make test-linux-memory test-rocm-memory` on an otherwise idle Strix.
  Admission checks must exclude `CmaFree` from Linux `MemAvailable`, even when
  `CmaTotal` reports zero, and refuse oversized pinned allocations before
  entering the driver. Keep an independent process-group memory watchdog for
  model tests: monitor `max(0, MemAvailable - CmaFree)`, not `MemAvailable`
  alone, and stop below 3 GiB usable. Never run primitive benchmarks or builds
  beside a resident model, even if the model process is paused. Keep logs
  outside `/tmp` so a reboot does not erase the failure evidence.
- After resident cache changes, exercise plain Flash and checkpoint-matched
  DSpark at the default context and prefill capacity. Required weights and
  session buffers must fit before optional Q8-to-FP16 expansion. Record the
  lowest usable RAM and inspect the kernel journal for OOM/GPU errors after
  each run; a monitor-terminated run is not a pass.
- After GLM attention changes, run `make test-glm53-kda-rocm
  test-glm-attention-rocm`. Repeat the attention test with
  `DS4_ROCM_GLM_SELECTED_ATTN_HEAD_TILE=1` to cover the single-head fallback.
  Require correct handling of padded, out-of-range, and entirely empty
  selections in both FP32 and FP16 caches, causal masking on continued
  prefill, and reference agreement for indexer normalization and split
  attention. `tests/test_glm_attention_rocm --bench` measures the attention
  primitive; it does not replace whole-model timing. Unload all models
  before this benchmark; do not run it beside a paused resident scorer.
- Compare before/after official continuation scores using the same GGUF and
  the matching fixture directory from section 3. For GLM 5.3 Flash use
  `gguf-tools/quality-testing/data/glm53-flash-openrouter-zai-fp8-100/manifest.tsv`.
  Record NLL, first-token matches, and matching-prefix length. These GLM
  prompts are short: they do not exercise the sparse-attention boundary.
  Also test initial and continued prefill across 2051 and 4096 tokens, including
  non-multiple-of-four frontiers, and compare with the scalar attention
  control. Do not claim a long-context quality improvement from unchanged
  short-prompt scores. Use the long Z.AI FP8 fixture and its rendered-prefix
  procedure in section 3 for this comparison.
- After MXFP4 or ROCm routed-MoE changes, run `make test-mxfp4-rocm`. Require
  zero `failures` for both `mid` and `out` at 1, 3, 32, 128, and 512 tokens,
  followed by `MXFP4 ROCm routed MoE: PASS`.
- Use the q2 Flash imatrix GGUF for release smoke tests:
  `DeepSeek-V4-Flash-IQ2XXS-w2Q2K-AProjQ8-SExpQ8-OutQ8-chat-v2-imatrix-0731.gguf`.
- Do not use the mixed q2-q4 or Q4 Flash GGUFs for routine Strix Halo QA yet.
  They are dangerous on this machine for now because the ROCm path can hit
  system OOM instead of failing cleanly.
- Run a short CLI prompt:
  `./ds4 -m gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-IQ2XXS-w2Q2K-AProjQ8-SExpQ8-OutQ8-chat-v2-imatrix-0731.gguf --ctx 4096 --nothink -p "Reply with exactly: OK"`.
- For DeepSeek Flash and GLM 5.3 Flash decode, confirm the default path uses
  prequantized Q8 activations. Repeat the same greedy run with
  `DS4_ROCM_Q8_PREQUANT_DECODE=0` only as a diagnostic control. The default
  must be materially faster and must still pass the matching continuation-
  quality gate. `--quality` must stay on the full-FP32 activation path.
- Test DSpark with the matched 0731 target and support files:
  `DS4_BIN=./ds4 DS4_DSPARK_MODEL=gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-IQ2XXS-w2Q2K-AProjQ8-SExpQ8-OutQ8-chat-v2-imatrix-0731.gguf DS4_DSPARK_SUPPORT=gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark-support-0731.gguf DS4_DSPARK_FIXTURE_TOKENS=64 sh tests/dspark_acceptance_fixture.sh`.
  Require proposals, accepted draft tokens, at least one direct state commit,
  zero verifier errors, and no unexplained replay fallbacks. With
  `DS4_DSPARK_SPEC_LOG=1`, a five-of-six commit may report `prefix-extended`:
  ROCm retains four prefix snapshots and replays just the fifth token.
  This bounded fallback is expected; other replays need investigation.
  Record ordinary and DSpark
  generation speed separately. When direct verifier-state handling changes,
  also compare with a test-only build of its immediate replay predecessor; the
  direct build must be faster. DSpark is not currently expected to beat
  ordinary ROCm decode, so do not describe it as a ROCm speedup without a new
  measurement.
- Repeat one opportunistic DSpark run with
  `--temp 1 --top-p 0.95 --min-p 0.05`, then repeat it with
  `--mtp-exact-sampling`. The current 128-token code references are
  16.26 t/s ordinary, 12.28 t/s opportunistic, and 13.52 t/s exact, with no
  verifier errors. This is a correctness gate, not a ROCm speed claim; the
  ROCm batched verifier is still too expensive.
- Run one longer prompt if ROCm kernels, backend hooks, tensor loading, model
  cache, KV cache, or graph prefill code changed.
- Run the GLM Q2 release model through ROCm SSD streaming with at least four
  generated tokens:
  `./ds4 --rocm -m gguf/GLM-5.2-UD-Q2_K_RoutedQ2K.gguf --ssd-streaming --ctx 4096 --nothink --tokens 4 -p "Reply with exactly: OK"`.
  Startup must select a cache budget that passes the memory guard without an
  override, and both compact indexed prefill and decode must complete.
- Repeat the ROCm GLM smoke with an overlarge byte target and with a one-expert
  target. The byte target is a hint and must be reduced using current Linux
  `MemAvailable - CmaFree` as well as the backend limit. The one-expert target must use
  the per-layer fallback. After each run, confirm SSH remains responsive and
  no OOM kill, GPU reset, or reboot was recorded.
- Run one longer GLM prompt with the release-advertised Strix context after
  changes to GLM attention, typed quantized projections, streaming expert
  caches, or memory budgeting. Record the context, cache split, and whether
  the continuation stays free of token-corruption markers.
- Run the same GLM model with `--mtp-timing --temp 0`. At least one draft
  verification cycle must complete without a `glm mtp step failed` message.
- Record startup memory/cache messages, prefill speed, generation speed, and
  whether the backend reports `ROCm backend initialized`.

## 10. Distributed Inference

Distributed code has regressed around route setup, KV snapshots, request IDs,
and split model loading.  Test it whenever distributed, KV, session, or model
loading code changes.

- Prefer `mac-m5max-it` and `mac-m5max-us` for Metal distributed tests.  Use the
  TB5 point-to-point link when it is working; otherwise note that the run used
  WiFi/VPN routing.
- Start workers first, then the coordinator.
- Test a small prompt and a longer prompt.
- Verify the coordinator waits for a complete route and exits cleanly.
- Verify `Ctrl+C` returns control after the current distributed token or chunk
  drains.
- Save and restore a distributed KV snapshot if that code changed.
- If CUDA distributed is relevant, test across the CUDA hosts and record
  generation speed, not just "it works".

## 11. Disk KV Cache

Disk KV cache bugs are high impact for server users.

- Start the server with:
  `./ds4-server --ctx 100000 --kv-disk-dir /tmp/ds4-kv --kv-disk-space-mb 8192`.
- Run the same request twice and verify the second request hits cache.
- Fill the cache enough to trigger eviction; verify the newly-written entry is
  not evicted and useful anchors are retained.
- Test rejection of incompatible checkpoints when model, quantization, context,
  or raw/compressed KV layout changes.
- Test stripped agent sessions: `/strip <id>` then `/switch <id>` should rebuild
  by prefill and render sane history.

## 12. Server APIs

The server must keep compatibility across OpenAI, Responses, and Anthropic
clients.

- `GET /v1/models/deepseek-v4-flash` and `GET /v1/models/deepseek-v4-pro`
  should both serve whichever GGUF is loaded.
- Test OpenAI chat completion, OpenAI Responses, and Anthropic messages.
- After tool-parser changes, run `make test-frontends` and
  `make test-session-state`. These targets do not load model weights. Repeat
  the frontend suites with ASan/UBSan for parser and buffer changes.
- Test both DeepSeek DSML and GLM tool syntax. Split closing delimiters at
  every byte boundary; sampled argument text must not become greedy syntax
  merely because a token ends in `<`. Literal thinking/tool markers inside
  arguments must not end the call. Check ordinary HTML entities, literal
  closing-wrapper escapes, and repeated escape spellings through rendering,
  parsing, streaming and canonical history replay.
- Truncate a tool argument using a small output budget and an explicit client
  stop, with and without streaming. Preserve `length` versus `stop`, never
  invent a complete action from an unfinished argument, and do not retry after
  a client stop. Model-error recovery must share the original output budget;
  usage includes the failed attempt. Partial SSE arguments may remain partial.
- Run a real Pi or other coding-client read/write/edit/build/test loop with
  GLM MTP and matching DeepSeek DSpark, in default and exact-sampling modes.
  Discard unseen speculative suffixes after tool/stop markers. Exact sampling
  must resample when the parser changes sampling mode; default opportunistic
  decoding should retain already-verified greedy drafts across that change.
  Check tool-result continuation through all three API formats. Responses
  requires full input replay, not an unsupported `previous_response_id`.
- Exercise actual `ds4-server` coding sessions, not only direct ds4-agent or
  isolated HTTP requests. Use Pi, OpenCode or another supported coding client
  for several read/edit/build/test rounds, including a harmless tool failure
  and recovery. Grow the conversation past 4K tokens and continue it.
  Capture `--trace` and check tool IDs, raw tool replay, rendered prompts,
  cache source, matched-prefix length and continued-prefill size after each
  tool result. An unchanged history should retain its reusable prefix;
  investigate repeated full prefills or unexplained canonicalization rebuilds.
  Conversely, editing an earlier message must invalidate the changed suffix.
  Compare a continued request with a fresh replay of the same full history,
  checking tool arguments, coherent output and context isolation. Record any
  necessary rebuild and its latency rather than counting a working tool alone
  as proof that prefix matching works.
- With vision enabled, run `python3 tests/test_server_vision_cache.py --url
  http://127.0.0.1:8000 --output /tmp/vision-cache-qa` against an otherwise idle
  server. Repeat for GLM and DeepSeek, with ordinary and batched sessions.
  Appending an image must retain the matching text/image prefix; replaying old
  images must reuse their encoder output. Changed, removed or reordered old
  images must not reuse incompatible KV. Include visible-history replay that
  omits hidden reasoning, concurrent requests, and a roughly 50K-token prefix
  (`--archive-lines 4200 --append-only`, with a sufficiently large `--ctx`).
- Run `python3 tests/test_server_vision_agent.py --url http://127.0.0.1:8000
  --pi /path/to/pi --output /tmp/vision-agent-qa` for both vision models. Pi must
  actually read the two images, edit the program and pass the independent
  output checks through Chat Completions, Responses and Anthropic. Image tool
  results must arrive as images, not disappear or become literal placeholders.
  Check cached-token accounting after every image-bearing tool continuation.
- Test SSE streaming with thinking enabled and disabled.
- Test keepalive during long prefill and confirm clients do not time out.
- In batched mode, close clients while their requests are queued, prefilling,
  and streaming decode. Repeat across OpenAI chat, Responses, Anthropic, and
  completions. Abandoned work must stop at the next backend-safe boundary, and
  a valid request after each cancellation must complete normally.
- For the repeatable chat-completions cancellation and slot-reuse gate, run
  `python3 tests/test_server_batching.py --url http://127.0.0.1:8000 --pairs 2
  --workers 4 --case short-sampled --max-tokens 12 --cancel-first 4`. Then run
  at least twelve short four-request waves against the same four-slot server.
  Every pair must remain deterministic and the server must answer `/v1/models`
  after malformed JSON and an over-context request.
- Only after receiving explicit permission for this QA pass, start
  `ds4-server` on the eight-L40S CUDA TP target with the release TP options and
  verify all 16 100k-context sessions allocate. Startup must report a
  2048-token prefill cap; a silent fallback to 4096 is an OOM regression.
- Test `--trace` and confirm rendered prompts, cache decisions, generated text,
  and tool-parser events are useful without leaking unrelated state.

September 6 focused tool-call QA passed with resident Flash 0731 Q2 + DSpark
and GLM 5.3 Flash Q2 + MTP on the GB10 Spark, using 8K contexts. Pi completed
read/write/edit/build/test loops in default and exact-sampling modes for both
models. Direct ds4-agent tasks also passed, preserving literal HTML entities
through file creation and editing. Independent 1,650-case clamp checks passed
for each generated program. OpenAI streaming/nonstreaming, Anthropic and
Responses tool-result continuations passed; output-limit and client-stop
cases returned no fabricated complete call. Disconnected tool streams were
followed by valid replies in under a second. Metal and CUDA frontend builds
were warning-free; model-free frontend, CPU ASan/UBSan, session-state and TP
command tests passed.

This is not full-model or full-backend release sign-off. The reported full
GLM 5.3 Q4 failure on a 512 GB Ultra was not reproduced with its exact weights,
prompt and request settings. Capture raw output, source revision, output
budget and stop reason before attributing `unterminated tool call` to inference
quality or memory. Adversarial live prompts asking both models to copy literal
thinking/tool-end tags were not copied faithfully: traces showed the models
changed the text before parsing. Deterministic parser/stream tests preserve
those markers, but that does not establish model-level copying accuracy.

## 13. ds4-agent

The agent is the most stateful component.  Test it manually, not only by build.

- Startup banner, status bar, help, `/power`, `/save`, `/list`, `/switch`,
  `/history`, `/compact`, `/new`, `/del`, and `/strip`.
- Ctrl+C during generation, during prefill, during a web fetch, and during a
  long tool call.  After `Stopped by user`, typing a new prompt must work.
- Queue messages while the model is busy.  Queued messages must not skip tool
  execution; after tool results, the queued user text must be provided.
- Force context pressure with `python3 tests/test_agent_compaction.py --binary
  ./ds4-agent --model MODEL.gguf --vision VISION.gguf --ctx 4096
  --output /tmp/agent-compaction-qa` (requires `pyte` and a C compiler; use 8192
  for DeepSeek). Check nearly full input, mid-response compaction, the compiled
  code oracle, output-budget accounting, oversized-input rejection and a real
  tool task afterward. An unfinished assistant response must resume without
  dropping partial words or code lines. An unfinished tool call must never run.
  Repeat with `--think --tokens 3000`, GLM `--mtp`, and DeepSeek
  `--dspark MATCHING_SUPPORT.gguf`. Summaries must record unfinished work,
  not invent its solution; validate the resulting code independently.
- Restore an already full session saved by the previous release and continue a
  coding task. Summary generation must have reserved space or summarize a
  bounded prefix while retaining every unsummarized token. Cancel compaction
  and continue again; do not lose the original conversation on failure. Repeat
  manual compaction, queued input, save/restore and thinking-enabled generation.
  Check task completion and constraints, not just the absence of an error.
- Read/search/edit/write tools:
  create a temp project and ask for edits. By default, verify that exact old/new
  replacements work and the tool prompt does not advertise `[upto]`. In a
  separate `--edit-upto` run, verify anchored edits fail safely on ambiguous
  matches and do not require retyping whole files.
- Real coding edit loop:
  delete `/tmp/mymandel`, ask ds4-agent to create a small C ASCII Mandelbrot
  program there, build and run it, then in a second user turn ask for a small
  modification that should naturally use the edit tool, such as changing the
  ASCII character ramp or output dimensions.  Verify the agent edits the
  existing file instead of rewriting the whole project, and that the final
  program still builds and runs.
- For GLM-5.3 integrated MTP, repeat a long-context edit/build/test task after
  the prompt crosses token 4,096. Require real file and shell tool calls,
  accepted and rejected draft cycles, and no `glm mtp: GLM 5.3 verify failed`
  message. Continue the same session after one harmless tool error and after a
  snapshot restore so a hidden MTP fallback or damaged recurrent state is not
  mistaken for success.
- With a matched DSpark support file and temperature 1, repeat a coding-tool
  turn that crosses sampled prose, greedy DSML structure, parameter text, and
  back to sampled prose. Require the tool to execute, the final answer to be
  valid, and DSpark stats to show zero verifier errors and no unexplained
  replay fallbacks (see the bounded-prefix exception in section 9).
  Run the opportunistic default and `--mtp-exact-sampling`. The M5 Max
  opportunistic smoke created, compiled, and ran a C program printing
  `OPPORTUNISTIC_OK`, accepting 196 of 235 draft tokens.
- After message-format changes, run `make test-session-state`. Text-only
  observations through the multimodal API must equal ordinary message tokens
  for Flash, PRO and GLM, including closing-wrapper escaping. They must not
  require a vision model. A rejection here once masqueraded as context
  exhaustion after even a tiny shell result; increasing context cannot fix it.
  Rendering/image-observation errors must be reported directly without
  compacting the conversation as though it had run out of context.
- Bash tools:
  test short output, large output truncation, non-zero exit output, long-running
  jobs, `bash_status`, and `bash_stop`.
- Web tools:
  `google_search` and `visit_page` should ask for visible Chrome approval with
  timeout, open pages without stealing focus when possible, extract Markdown,
  close tabs, and handle consent/privacy walls as tool errors the model can see.
- TUI:
  test multiline prompt editing, history navigation, queued prompt display,
  status bar fill to terminal width, syntax highlighting in Markdown/code blocks,
  and SSH/remote terminal flicker.

September 8 focused regression pass on M5 Max IT, using GLM 5.3 Flash Q2 and
DeepSeek Flash Vision Exp mixed Q2/Q4 with their vision encoders:

- Both models passed the image-prefix suite and Pi editing tasks through Chat
  Completions, Responses and Anthropic. Changed, removed and reordered images
  invalidated the old prefix; unchanged images reused their encoder output.
- At 56,035 GLM and 53,615 DeepSeek initial prompt tokens, adding each image
  retained the entire old frontier. Final short follow-ups took 0.252 and
  0.281 seconds respectively, with 58,268 and 54,442 cached tokens.
- Forced 4K/8K compaction passed real tool tasks and an 80-function compiled
  code oracle, including thinking, GLM MTP and DeepSeek DSpark. A partial write
  had no side effects before retry and then produced all 300 expected lines.
  Full older-session restore, cancelled compaction, images across compaction,
  queued input and subsequent editing also passed.
- Frontend/session unit tests, terminal PTY tests and ASan/UBSan-instrumented
  frontend tests passed. Builds were warning-free. This was not a full release
  matrix: CUDA, ROCm, TP and the reported 100K M3 Ultra setup were not tested.
- A separate DSpark stop-boundary rewind can still force a prefix rebuild.
  The same short prose/tool test reproduced identical rebuilds with both the
  old and fixed agents. Do not mistake compaction correctness for fixing this
  pre-existing speculative-cache performance limitation.

## 14. Download Script And Model Files

- Test `download_model.sh` in a temporary directory so local weights are not
  overwritten.
- Test one Flash target and one PRO target enough to verify URL, resume, Hugging
  Face CLI/curl behavior, file naming, and symlink policy.
- Verify legacy removed targets fail clearly.
- Verify README model names match the script and Hugging Face repository.

## 15. Performance And Power

- Run `ds4-bench` on the release machine and compare with tracked CSV baselines.
- Test `--power 100` is not throttled.
- Test `--power 50` visibly reduces duty cycle in CLI, server, agent, eval, and
  bench where practical.
- Confirm context buffer size, raw KV rows, compressed KV rows, and mmap behavior
  match expectations for 32k, 100k, and any release-advertised context size.

## 16. Speed Regression

Performance is a release gate. A correct result that is unexpectedly much
slower still needs an explanation before release.

Use the same commit, GGUF checksum, prompt, context frontier, generated-token
count, power setting, and backend flags as the reference run. Let the machine
become idle, discard the first warm-up run, then record the median of three
runs. Do not compare different model checkpoints or quantizations. For batched
tests, record aggregate and per-session decode speed.

- A slowdown over 5% requires a clean rerun and investigation.
- A repeatable slowdown over 10% in prefill, decode, or aggregate batched
  decode is a release blocker unless the change and tradeoff are documented.
- Keep the complete `ds4-bench` CSV. A single short-prompt average is not enough
  to detect a context-dependent regression.
- Compare startup time and peak memory as well as tokens per second when model
  loading, caches, streaming, or temporary arenas changed.
- Run the backend-specific batch tests in sections 4 and 8. Fast single-session
  decode does not substitute for aggregate multi-session throughput.

September 5 ROCm attention review, GLM 5.3 Flash Q2, Promessi Sposi, 8,192
allocated context and 32 generated tokens (one matched before/after run):

| Workload | Previous build | Corrected default | Corrected scalar control |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Initial 4,096-token prefill | 80.65 t/s | 76.15 t/s | 33.81 t/s |
| 2,048-token append after 4,096 | 21.45 t/s | 67.28 t/s | 20.92 t/s |
| Decode at 6,144 | 11.70 t/s | 11.68 t/s | 11.69 t/s |

The previous build incorrectly used dense attention through 4,096 tokens.
The corrected graph switches after 2,051, following the pool selection rule;
its 5.6% initial-prefill cost must not be mistaken for timing noise. Older GLM
measurements above this boundary used the old graph. Continued prefill improves
about 3.2x over corrected scalar attention; decode is unchanged. Repeat these
measurements as three-run medians for release sign-off.

The complete stored GLM fixture is unchanged on ROCm: NLL `0.462125091`,
first-token matches `90/100`, mean greedy prefix `7.320`. CUDA scored
`0.461783551`, `90/100`, and `7.490`. These short prompts do not test the
corrected boundary. Independent attention tests pass on Metal, CUDA and ROCm;
whole-model warm/cold continued prefill passes on CUDA and ROCm. CUDA also
passes snapshot/MTP restore and reuse with a 2,771-token prompt. Fresh
long-context scoring now uses eight September 5 Z.AI FP8 references, covering
roughly 3K-7.3K prompt tokens and 740 answer tokens. Use the official low-effort
template and returned reasoning as the prefix; the provider requires reasoning.
Do not compare these answers against the no-thinking template.

| GLM Q2 long-reference path | NLL | First-token matches | Mean greedy prefix |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ROCm corrected default | 0.661721610 | 6/8 | 2.500 |
| ROCm old dense-cutoff control | 0.661579639 | 6/8 | 2.500 |
| ROCm corrected scalar control | 0.674282960 | 6/8 | 2.500 |
| CUDA corrected default | 0.680093110 | 6/8 | 2.500 |

The old-cutoff control retains the other correctness fixes. Its 0.021% NLL
difference is neutral (four case wins each). The corrected fast path is 1.86%
better than scalar on this set (six case wins versus two). This is focused
regression evidence, not a broad quality claim or API-logit parity: the API
returned no logprobs and may normalize reasoning whitespace. All runs completed
with at least 11.3 GiB usable RAM. CUDA's complete long-fixture TSV is identical
before and after the Q8 scratch change below.

The matched Flash 0731 Q2 ROCm fixture also has unchanged scores in all 100
cases: NLL `0.398181736`, first-token matches `56/100`, mean prefix `5.170`.
One paired timing run measured initial 2K prefill at `180.73/181.40` t/s,
a 2K append at `207.67/207.69` t/s, and 4K decode at `14.69/14.69` t/s.
Those timings predate the final memory-policy fixes. The subsequent DSpark
startup exhausted pinned memory: Linux's apparent availability included about
13.2 GiB of CMA pages that these allocations cannot use. After the reboot,
allocation checks exclude CMA, optional Q8 expansion is deferred until required
buffers exist, and tightly sized model arenas remove 13.38 GiB of wasted GLM
capacity. Do not reuse the earlier unadjusted memory minima as safety evidence.

The final build passed both complete 100-case fixtures with the same scores,
GLM snapshot/MTP/reuse at 2,771 prompt tokens, three identical finite vision
encodes, and strict two-session full-logit checks for GLM and Flash. All five
DSpark cases completed in greedy, opportunistic and exact-sampling modes with
zero verifier errors. Greedy outputs matched ordinary decode. One sampled
five-of-six commit used the documented one-token prefix extension. DSpark
kept at least 7.97 GiB usable; this is not a claim that it beats ordinary
decode on every prompt. GLM 5.2 SSD smokes passed with automatic sizing, a
500 GiB hint reduced to fit, and the one-expert per-layer fallback. There was
no new OOM, GPU reset or reboot during these final tests.

Final GLM timing was 77.33 t/s initial 4K prefill, 68.22 t/s for the 2K append,
and 11.74 t/s decode at 6K. Flash's initial 2K prefill was 154.81 t/s, about
15% below the earlier build; its append and 4K decode remained 207.18 and
14.68 t/s. Deferring optional cache construction moves work to the first
request. A separate same-engine test of three fresh sessions measured
168.63/207.41/206.90 t/s with byte-identical full logits, after 18.35 seconds
of engine startup. Record this cold-request cost; warm results alone do not
establish unchanged startup-to-first-response latency. These focused runs do
not replace the three-run release medians.

September 5 DGX Spark, fully resident Flash 0731 Q2, no speculative decoding:
three interleaved medians per build after warmup, 128 teacher-forced decode
tokens, Promessi Sposi, 9,216 allocated context. Reusing aligned Q8 scratch
removes per-call pool allocations without changing the computation.

| Context | Previous decode | Q8 scratch reuse | Gain | Prefill before / after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 2,048 | 17.90 t/s | 19.25 t/s | 7.5% | 823.06 / 823.49 t/s |
| 4,096 | 15.23 t/s | 16.22 t/s | 6.5% | 898.69 / 899.89 t/s |
| 8,192 | 15.01 t/s | 15.97 t/s | 6.4% | 931.53 / 931.17 t/s |

Full prefill and post-decode logits matched exactly at all three frontiers.
All 100 Flash-0731 continuation scores were also identical: NLL `0.404714573`,
first-token matches `55/100`, mean prefix `4.890`. The Q8 scratch test covers
24 shapes, missing/undersized scratch, and graph replay with changing inputs;
Compute Sanitizer memcheck reported zero errors. This is a single-GPU result,
not a claim about multi-GPU speed or speculative acceptance.
The final CUDA and ROCm builds were warning-free; ROCm attention, KDA and memory
admission tests passed after removing the unused Q8 matvec kernels.

September 6 DGX Spark DSpark checks use the matching Flash 0731 Q2 target and
0731 support file, fully resident. Three interleaved runs per variant, 256
generated tokens, 4,096 allocated context, prefill chunk 512, and the same C
hash-table/prose prompts and sampling settings as the M5 comparisons below:

| Workload | Ordinary decode | Previous DSpark | New DSpark |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| C hash table, temperature 0 | 19.72 t/s | 23.44 t/s | 31.41 t/s |
| C hash table, temperature 1 | 19.53 t/s | 25.03 t/s | 29.98 t/s |
| Unpredictable prose, temperature 1 | 19.53 t/s | 18.16 t/s | 18.81 t/s |

Temperature 1 uses the existing opportunistic policy, not exact sampling.
Coding improves 59%/54% over ordinary decode and 34%/20% over previous DSpark.
Low-acceptance prose still favors ordinary decoding. The defaults batch the
seed with useful longer drafts and use existing aligned kernels for small Q8
and IQ2/Q2 batches. No new enabling switches or production kernels are needed.
A separate three-run paired ablation gives `30.46/28.65` t/s for the expert
dispatch alone at temperature 0/1 and `31.39/30.08` with the Q8 dispatch too,
an additional 3.1%/5.0%. The retained commits are `df80a87d`, `f6c169f8`,
`45f54e9d` and `2803820d`; the agent observation fix is `558cd343`.
Single paired checks at 400/800-token limits on the same greedy C prompt give
`19.73/19.62` t/s ordinary versus `33.00/33.16` t/s new DSpark, with zero
verifier errors or replays. Keep these separate from the three-run medians.
The live Promessi Sposi sweep (128 generated tokens, 9,216 allocated context,
chunk 512) has low draft acceptance: at 2K/4K/8K, total generation is
`19.24/16.26/15.97` t/s ordinary, `18.12/15.44/15.11` with seed batching
disabled on the new kernels, and `18.48/16.24/15.67` with the new defaults.
The disabled-seed control is not the old executable. Initial/continued prefill
is roughly `625/660/650` t/s in these runs, with no material change. This
single paired sweep confirms working continued contexts, not a universal
DSpark speedup. Retain the complete CSVs, including first-cycle latency.

The normal 100-case continuation TSV remains
byte-identical to the control above. With six-token prefill chunks, control and
candidate NLL are `0.422579437` and `0.424830442` (+0.533%); first-token matches
are `50/51`, mean greedy prefixes `5.050/5.260`, and top-token agreement
`86.21/86.42%`. Cases favor the candidate/control `48/52`. A paired case bootstrap
gives a 95% interval of `[-0.00702, 0.01153]` for the NLL/token difference.
This is mixed numerical variation, not bit-exact inference or evidence of a
quality improvement. Do not hide the slightly higher loss behind the better
greedy agreement.

The 54 Q8 scratch/graph cases and the tiny IQ2/Q2 expert tests pass, including
different gate/up weights and exact batched-versus-single-row comparisons.
Compute Sanitizer memcheck, racecheck and synccheck report zero errors.
Two- and six-session server-prefill/decode oracles pass 24 steps with
byte-identical full logits versus separate sessions. Greedy, opportunistic,
exact-sampling and forced-partial fixtures pass all five prompts with zero
verifier errors. CUDA retains five intermediate prefixes, eliminating replay
in these ordinary partial-accept cases. The continued-state oracle passes two
128-token phases at each of the 127/2047/4095/8191-token frontiers; worst
serial-target argmax gaps are `0.026638/0.254242/0/0.249626`, within the existing
verifier bound. Minimum usable RAM during these checks was 8.82 GiB, excluding
CMA. These are single-Spark checks, not a new multi-GPU or all-backend sign-off.

Both opportunistic and exact DSpark agent runs created a C clamp function,
compiled and ran its tests, edited the degenerate-interval cases, then compiled
and ran again. An independent exhaustive check of small integer ranges passed
for both generated programs. Draft acceptance was `875/1017` and `431/504`,
respectively, with zero verifier errors or replay fallbacks. The first attempt
stopped after announcing a directory inspection; a fresh-cache retry exposed
the text-only tool-observation rejection described in section 8. After fixing
that shared helper, both complete tasks passed. The helper's CPU regression
also passed AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. Do not count the
failed attempts as passing runs or attribute the context error to insufficient
RAM.

For M5 dense-kernel changes, run `MTL_DEBUG_LAYER=1 make test-metal-dense-mpp`.
It checks Q8 decode and Q4_0/Q4_K prefill against exactly representable CPU
dots, including repeated calls, partial token tiles and untouched output tails.
Keep host threadgroup allocations in sync with kernel staging: the dense
double-buffered TensorOps kernel needs 8 KiB, not 4 KiB.

For M5 routed-prefill changes, run `make test-metal-moe-prefill`. It compares
gate/up, FP16 intermediate, expert partials and final outputs against the
unpacked path, including empty experts, tile tails and scratch reuse.
Then build `make metal-prefill-variant-bench metal-decode-schedule-bench` and
use a resident Flash Q2 or mixed Q2/Q4 model for interleaved full-logit checks:

```sh
speed-bench/metal_prefill_variant_bench -m "$MODEL" \
  --prompt-file speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt --prefix-tokens 2048 \
  --warmup-tokens 2048 --candidate-env DS4_METAL_DISABLE_ROUTED_MPP_PACKED
speed-bench/metal_prefill_variant_bench -m "$MODEL" \
  --prompt-file speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt --prefix-tokens 16384 \
  --initial-tokens 12288 --warmup-tokens 2048 \
  --candidate-env DS4_METAL_DISABLE_ROUTED_MPP_PACKED
speed-bench/metal_decode_schedule_bench -m "$MODEL" \
  --prompt-file speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt --prefix-tokens 8192 \
  --ctx 9216 --tokens 256 --candidate-env DS4_METAL_DISABLE_ROUTED_MPP_PACKED
```

Here `control` is the default fast path; `candidate` disables packing.
Require exact logits and no decode regression. On M5 Max, Flash Vision Exp
Q2 measured 734.40 versus 711.89 t/s at 2K; mixed Q2/Q4 measured 615.01
versus 604.62 t/s for a 4K append to 12K. Decode was unchanged. These are
interleaved sustained measurements, not cold-run peaks. Packing is an M5
resident-prefill optimization; it does not claim pre-M5 or streaming gains.

For Metal DSpark changes, test matching 0731 and Vision Exp target/drafter
pairs. Run the acceptance fixture at temperature 0, at temperature 1 with
forced partial acceptance, and with `--mtp-exact-sampling`. Require zero
verifier errors and consistent seed/draft counters. A batched seed is a
normally chosen target token, not a successful draft prediction.

Resident M5 Q2 uses seed batching for longer proposals; short proposals first
decode the seed normally. Poor acceptance windows pause drafting for 32
cycles before trying again. `DS4_DSPARK_SEED_BATCH=0` retains the previous
schedule for diagnostic comparisons. This also applies to two-M5 TP with Q2,
mixed Q2/Q4 and MXFP4 experts. Streaming, exact sampling and other device/weight
combinations retain their existing defaults.

Compare code and prose, not just a high-acceptance copy prompt. Use at least
256 generated tokens at temperatures 0 and 1; also sweep 2K/4K/8K/16K live
frontiers with continued prefill. Record ordinary decode, old DSpark and
default DSpark separately. Seed batching must not make low-acceptance cases
worse than the previous DSpark path. It does not promise to beat ordinary
decode on every prompt. Run the six-session full-logit batch oracle too,
since a six-row verifier shares routed kernels with session batching.

September 4 M5 measurements, 256 generated tokens, 4096 allocated context:

| Model and prompt | Previous DSpark | Default DSpark |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 0731 Q2, C hash table, temperature 0 | 55.71 t/s | 62.95 t/s |
| 0731 Q2, C hash table, temperature 1 | 50.95 t/s | 61.58 t/s |
| Vision Exp mixed Q2/Q4, C hash table, temperature 0 | 41.65 t/s | 48.86 t/s |
| Vision Exp mixed Q2/Q4, C hash table, temperature 1 | 43.56 t/s | 47.24 t/s |

These are three-run medians, alternating schedules with the matching drafter,
`--nothink --top-p 0.95 --min-p 0.05 --seed 12345`. The prompt is:
"Write a complete C hash table implementation with string keys, insert, find,
delete, and a test main. Output only C code."

For two-M5 TP, test the MXFP4 and mixed Q2/Q4 Vision Exp models with their
matching drafter. Use the same sampling settings and 256-token C prompt above,
plus the prompt "Write an unpredictable surreal scene with constantly changing
imagery and no repeated phrases." September 5 measurements (two repetitions,
reversed order on the second; both hosts on RDMA, 50/50 residency):

| Model and prompt | Previous TP DSpark | Default TP DSpark |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| MXFP4, C hash table, temperature 0 | 41.09 t/s | 50.76 t/s |
| MXFP4, C hash table, temperature 1 | 41.47 t/s | 48.15 t/s |
| MXFP4, prose, temperature 1 | 38.62 t/s | 45.99 t/s |
| Mixed Q2/Q4, C hash table, temperature 0 | 40.60 t/s | 49.52 t/s |
| Mixed Q2/Q4, C hash table, temperature 1 | 41.74 t/s | 46.36 t/s |
| Mixed Q2/Q4, prose, temperature 1 | 37.64 t/s | 44.16 t/s |

Plain MXFP4 TP measured 53.19/50.93 t/s on that C prompt at temperature 0/1.
These DSpark gains are relative to previous DSpark, not a claim that speculation
always beats ordinary decode or that two hosts deliver twice the speed.

Also compare ordinary MXFP4 TP with and without
`DS4_METAL_DISABLE_ROUTED_MPP_PACKED=1`, using Promessi Sposi at 2K/4K/8K/16K
live frontiers. Repeat in reversed order and compare full frontier logits.
September 5 adjacent controls suggested roughly 3-5% faster prefill, but both
paths slowed during sustained runs; 16K results were variable. Five of six
runs were byte-identical at every frontier. One late control differed from
another control at 8K/16K (maximum 0.163/0.167, unchanged argmax), so investigate
reproducibility before attributing a difference to a new kernel.
The final adjacent old/new 2K/4K/8K runs measured 813.53/683.68/707.97 versus
888.45/703.16/691.96 prefill t/s; steady decode was 52.39/47.31/46.12 versus
52.33/47.38/46.29 t/s, with byte-identical frontier logits. This confirms
unchanged ordinary decode, not a uniform prefill gain at every context.

With DSpark, the continued-context 2K/4K/8K check measured 44.03/41.88/41.76
generation t/s versus 40.22/37.47/36.20 before these changes. All three prompt
frontiers matched the ordinary baseline byte-for-byte. The first 20 cases of
the checkpoint-matched Vision Exp continuation scorer were also byte-identical:
1280 target tokens, average NLL 0.179928298, first-token matches 19/20,
average common prefix 17 tokens. These are focused comparisons, not a full
100-case quality pass.

Require `MTL_DEBUG_LAYER=1 make test-metal-moe-prefill` on both M5s. This covers
packed MXFP4 prefill, both expert-ownership halves, tiny batches and the actual
4096/2048/4096 static shapes. Static two-to-six-row outputs must be exact against
per-row decode. The synthetic static-shape model uses about 3.2 GiB of memory.
`DS4_METAL_DISABLE_TP_BATCH_MOE=1` restores per-row verifier experts for diagnosis;
`DS4_METAL_DISABLE_M5_TP_MXFP4_STATIC=1` disables the static specialization.
Neither is needed to enable the fast path.

Build `make tests/test_metal_tp_spec`. With the worker connected as usual,
run the coordinator with:

```

This checks committed tokens against serial target logits at 127- and
4095-token prefixes, then appends to each live speculative cache. Require
six-token commits and exercise partial prefixes, including five of six tokens.
The test uses the existing verifier oracle's 2.0-logit near-argmax bound; the
September 5 MXFP4 maxima were 0 and 0.0984. Also run the acceptance checks with
`--mtp-exact-sampling` and with forced low-confidence proposals. Both ranks must
exit cleanly, with no verifier errors or unexplained replay fallbacks.
Exact sampling under TP still intentionally replays partially rejected blocks;
those replays are expected, and seed batching must remain disabled in this mode.
One September 5 two-session run failed at the initial RDMA big-gate barrier.
Both ranks exited cleanly; instrumented and ordinary retries, plus four- and
six-session runs, passed. The cause was not established. Keep transport failures
in the record even when reruns pass; do not hide them by increasing timeouts.

Repeat the physical TP session oracle with two, four and six sessions. Do not
set `DS4_TEST_SKIP_MIXED`: ordinary decode and the mixed continued-prefill step
must both match full serial logits exactly. A regression once left the final
TP residual update deferred in mixed mode, producing a maximum logit difference
of 23.7409 despite choosing the same next token. Testing only argmax misses it.
After flushing that update before the output head, September 5 MXFP4 TP tests
passed exactly at all three session counts; mixed Q2/Q4 passed at six sessions
both in TP and on a single host.

Do not discard slow runs as noise: separate-process tests sometimes varied
by about 20%, including ordinary decoding. Vision Exp prose showed slower
outliers; matched GPU-monitored reruns measured about 41.1 versus 38.4 t/s,
and alternating within one loaded engine measured 40.4 versus 36.7 t/s
(medians after warm-up).
Investigate fresh-process variability separately from kernel cost. Ordinary
decoding still wins on this low-acceptance prompt.

These are the last known good observations available when this gate was added.
They are reference points for matching hardware and workloads, not performance
claims across different models or contexts.

## 17. DeepSeek V4.1 Flash

V4.1 is a different architecture and checkpoint, not a replacement filename for
V4 Flash. Use the matching vectors in
`gguf-tools/quality-testing/deepseek-v4.1-flash-20260910/manifest.tsv`.
The dataset README explains the temperature-one API logprobs: compare
teacher-forced probabilities and API top-token agreement, not sampled-prefix
length alone. Never refresh old Flash vectors through an API alias that now
serves V4.1.

Also score the 100 short general prompts in
`gguf-tools/quality-testing/deepseek-v4.1-flash-20260910-general/manifest.tsv`
when comparing quantizations. Keep this broader probability check separate from
the long sparse-boundary tests; neither substitutes for the other.

### Metal

- Audit the completed GGUF against its pinned source with
  `gguf-tools/deepseek41_validate_gguf.py --payload`, including native Engram rows.
  Repeat for calibrated weights using the actual imatrix. Record expert coverage;
  synthetic fixture statistics must never become a release calibration file.
  For Q4, pass `--quant q4` to both converter and validator. Convert from the
  original safetensors with the retained imatrix, not from the Q2 GGUF. A valid
  tensor inventory does not replace real-model quality tests for that recipe.
- Run `make test-engram test-deepseek41-gguf test-quality-api test-frontends`,
  the V4.1 manifest tests and the official RoPE/quantization primitive checks.
  Run `make test-download-model` to check verified downloads, damaged files,
  partial transfers and the default model link. Check the published artifacts
  using `ds41f-q2`, `ds41f-q4` and `ds41f-vision` on a runtime host. Q4 comes
  in two transport parts: check interrupted assembly, insufficient disk space,
  corrupt parts and the final complete-file checksum before opening the model.
- With real weights, run `tests/test_deepseek41_graph MODEL --session-fixture`
  and `tests/test_deepseek41_graph MODEL --partitions` under Metal API validation.
  Check restored continuation logits, compression carry, sliding-window wrap,
  cancellation and malformed snapshots. Zero-weight fixtures are not quality QA.
  On a sufficiently large resident Metal host, run
  `tests/test_deepseek41_prefill --resident MODEL speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt`.
  This grows two sessions beyond 130K tokens while mixing scalar, layer-major
  and deferred prefills; it checks progress, complete state and restored decode.
  Omit `--resident` for the bounded SSD variant through 113K. Never run the
  resident variant on a 128 GiB Mac.
  Run `tests/test_deepseek41_graph MODEL --long-sessions PROMPT_FILE` with the
  dataset's `prompts/case_016.txt` for incremental prefill and exact restored
  continuation checks through 16385 tokens. This uses two sessions and a shared
  64 GiB expert-cache budget; monitor memory and do not overlap another inference job.
- After prefill scheduling changes, run
  `tests/test_deepseek41_graph MODEL --prefill-parity speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt`
  under Metal API validation. This compares complete logits and all saved cache
  spans with token-major execution, including large continued chunks, snapshot
  restoration and cancellation. An in-flight partial layer stack must never
  be accepted as a valid snapshot.
  Run `make test-metal-ssd-experts test-metal-moe-prefill` too: seeded cache
  replacement must release physical buffers, not just reset entry counters.
  The SSD test covers IQ2 eight-expert and Q4/MXFP4 six-expert routes, cold/hot
  eviction, batched outputs and repeated physical-cache release. Its
  `--table-admission` mode must reject persistent full-expert tables during
  streaming, even with diagnostic table overrides. A resident one-row batch
  must not silently populate the SSD cache. For new large Q4 artifacts, start
  with a small cache and one continuation before the full scorer. Monitor host
  wired memory and swap independently of the engine's planned allocation;
  retained Metal residency sets can otherwise escape its accounting.
  `tests/test_metal_moe_prefill --ssd-address` checks the IQ2/Q2 address kernel
  across row counts that previously overflowed an unused narrow thread index.
  Compare short/long, initial/continued prefill with the same cache budget on
  the same host. Include first-token latency and steady decoding after prefill;
  a faster prefill that leaves a cold expert cache can lose overall.
- For the long-prompt resident-encoder schedule, run
  `tests/test_deepseek41_graph MODEL --encoder-parity speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt`
  and `--encoder-long-parity` with the same prompt file. These need an automatic
  expert cache large enough to hold the encoder; use one inference process per
  128 GiB host. Compare complete logits and every cache span at 16,385 tokens,
  then append and decode, including snapshot restoration. `--encoder-cancel`
  separately checks interruption after pinning the full encoder and rebuilding
  the session; the short test also cancels a partially loaded encoder.
  Confirm the cache budget is restored and no encoder pages remain pinned.
  Memory must replace the expert cache, not sit beside it. A smaller budget or
  failed residency request must retain the two-layer path, with Engram on disk.
  Measure both schedules at 8k and 16k, including loading, first decode latency
  and at least 512 generated tokens. Use
  `DS4_METAL_DISABLE_V41_ENCODER_RESIDENCY=1` for the two-layer control.
- Score both single-host SSD streaming and two-host TP over real RDMA. Cover
  127/128/129, 511/512/513, 1023/1024/1025 and 16383/16384/16385 prompt tokens,
  then continued prefills and a real CLI/agent/server coding task with tool calls.
  Compare bootstrap and calibrated weights on the same held-out cases.
  Also use the `20260911-long` and `20260911-extended` V4.1 manifests for
  8/16/32K and 64/96K prefixes. Compare whole-prompt paired probability scores;
  sampled API output is not a full-logit oracle. Investigate persistent TP
  differences instead of assuming that a different reduction order explains them.
- Exercise native resident and TP batching with unrelated sessions. Run
  `tests/test_metal_session_batch` with `DS4_TEST_BATCH_ISOLATION=1`,
  `DS4_TEST_SESSION_COUNT=2`, `4` and `8`, and `DS4_TEST_DECODE_STEPS=32`.
  Supply `DS4_TEST_MODEL` and an admitted `DS4_TEST_CONTEXT_SIZE`; repeat two
  sessions at 64K using `DS4_TEST_PROMPT_FILE`. This oracle changes companion
  prompts and row order, checks complete target logits exactly, tests invalid
  batches without advancing state, and resumes after a mixed prefill/decode call.
  Isolation does not establish equivalence to serial inference: separately run
  `score_official --session-batch N` on the short and long manifests. Measure
  aggregate throughput without Metal validation, including two-session cases.
  Require the `native_ds41=1` trace for admitted native shapes, including mixed
  batches with nonzero `prefill_rows`; a passing ordered fallback is not evidence
  for the native path. Image-bearing sessions currently use that fallback.
  Real concurrent server requests must also cover cancellation and prefix reuse;
  a serial prefill followed by batched decode is not a native mixed-layer path.
  Run `tests/test_metal_moe_prefill --v41-decode` for rows 1-9, including both
  TP ownership partitions. Its `--v41-q4-decode` mode checks the Q4 shape at
  rows 1-8 against independent one-row calls, both ownership partitions and
  untouched output tails. Run both: IQ2 success does not cover Q4 dispatch.
  Run `tests/test_deepseek41_graph --batch-admission`
  and `tests/test_deepseek41_graph MODEL --batch-head`; the latter compares
  every output logit with the scalar head and selected rows with double math.
  Use `DS4_TEST_MIXED_SHAPES=1` with `tests/test_metal_session_batch` for 1-7
  appended tokens sharing a batch with independent decoders. Repeat at 73,728
  context on a large resident host, not the 128 GiB RDMA pair: this fixture
  allocates ten sessions. Check causal state and subsequent decode at 64K.
  Keep HTTP identical-output comparisons at a fixed prefill chunk geometry;
  the default idle and concurrent schedules can round differently. Also run
  the default schedule for independent coding correctness and prefix reuse.
- Run `tests/test_metal_tp_cancel` over the physical RDMA pair. Interrupt at
  small and large prefill boundaries, reject a partial snapshot, then rebuild
  and decode on the same connection. Both peers must exit normally. Repeat
  shared transport changes with older Flash and GLM, not just V4.1.
  Run `make test-session-state` and delayed physical `tests/test_metal_tp_bulk`
  exchanges for decode, verify and bulk shapes. Both receive windows must be
  posted before either peer sends. Keep matching protocol versions on both
  hosts; a longer timeout is not a fix for a missing receive window.
- Run `tests/test_tp_tcp` on macOS as well as Linux after transport changes.
  Exercise both real loopback TCP and socket pairs with tiny buffers, including
  stalled peers and half-closes. Darwin `sendmsg(MSG_DONTWAIT)` alone can still
  block; the exchange must restore descriptor flags on success and failure.
- For vision, audit the separate encoder GGUF against the pinned source and run
  `tests/test_deepseek41_graph --vision-routing`. Compare
  `--vision-encoder VISION_GGUF IMAGE OUTPUT.f32` with independently evaluated
  official BF16 encoder outputs for OCR, layout, diagram and screenshot images.
  Build `tests/test_glm53_vision_prompt` (the shared vision-prompt oracle) and
  run its `--logit-oracle` check for non-finite values. Test
  `tests/test_glm53_vision_prompt MODEL VISION_GGUF IMAGE` in resident,
  SSD and physical TP modes, including SSD `--quality`. Check image replay,
  changed embeddings and restored logits, not only a plausible description.
  Run the server vision-cache suite with tool-result images, changed/reordered
  images, multiple sessions and thinking replay. An unchanged image must retain
  its prefix; a changed old image must invalidate the affected cache. Exercise
  native agent image tools too. Keep the older Flash encoder regression gates.
  Run `python3 tests/test_agent_vision.py --binary ./ds4-agent --model MODEL
  --vision VISION_GGUF --ssd-streaming --output /tmp/agent-vision-qa`, then
  repeat with `--ctx 73728 --archive-words 50000` and a fresh output directory.
  It must inspect two images separately, edit code from their contents, pass
  an independent output check and retain the prefix at every tool continuation.
  Omit `--ssd-streaming` only on a host admitted for full residency. Allow
  headroom above the 50K input for image tokens, tools and system reminders;
  a task compacted into a short context does not pass the long-context gate.
- Verify that Engram tables remain unmapped and unpinned in every mode, including
  weight warming and TP. On 128 GiB Macs, never try full main-model residency;
  use SSD streaming or one half of a two-Mac TP setup. Increase context gradually
  and monitor memory/swap. Larger-Mac residency requires separate physical QA.
  With both released Q2 and Q4 GGUFs, run `tests/test_deepseek41_graph MODEL --memory-plan`.
  It rejects Q4 residency on 128/256 GiB hosts and a Q4 shard on a 128 GiB rank,
  while admitting larger hosts and fitting the SSD cache to its remaining budget.
  The Q2 variant checks simulated 128/256/512 GiB admission and TP shard sizing.
  Neither variant allocates weights or context buffers; this is not physical-host QA.
  Repeat startup with `--warm-weights`: TP must warm only its owned shard,
  SSD streaming must skip the full-file pass, and inspection must not warm weights.
- Exercise `--think-level 0`, `1`, `25`, `100`, `/think 25`, `/think`, `--think`
  and `--think-max`; reject malformed/out-of-range values. Check changing effort
  in a live conversation invalidates the old prefix without losing its messages.
- Run `tests/test_agent_compaction.py` first at 4K, then at least 64K with
  the appropriate SSD or resident configuration. Check real read/edit/test
  tasks, automatic and mid-generation compaction, interruption, text session
  save/restore, cached-prefix reuse, generation budgets and recovery after an
  oversized message. Compile and independently test the generated code.
  The small-context run must exercise mid-generation compaction. The long run
  must retain at least 75% of its context for the coding turn, not compact
  before it; allow room for the system reminder inserted after 50K tokens.
  Repeat with `--interrupt-only` and a fresh output directory to interrupt
  generation and verify a real tool call in the same conversation afterward.
  For a served V4.1 model, run `tests/test_server_vision_agent.py` with
  `--model deepseek-v4.1-flash` against Chat, Responses and Anthropic. Require
  independently checked image-driven code edits and cached-prefix reuse,
  not just successful HTTP responses.
- Unsupported backends, pipeline and speculative modes must fail explicitly until
  their V4.1 implementation is validated; an older graph/drafter is not a fallback.

Historical September 10 focused V4.1 pass, implementation at `e4a7c0e1`, on the two
128 GiB M5 Max hosts only. Source revision
`df42c109f1defefcbfcedbe7d905718a12266e40`; routed gate/up IQ2_XXS, down Q2_K,
attention/shared/head Q8_0, native disk-only FP8 Engram tables. Both GGUFs
are 340.598 GiB, of which 188.833 GiB is Engram data. The calibrated artifact
is `DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-IQ2_XXS-Q2_K-imatrix.gguf`, SHA-256
`1ce6a8f8806205c13330d7ca287bd198331dc5ca35ccc5d8a9a92a188a6f6f42`.
The 8,192-token calibration observed 14,922 of 15,360 experts (97.15%);
unobserved experts retain the bootstrap fallback. Both source/payload audits
passed, including native Engram rows and source-reencoded expert samples.

The general 100-case fixture contains 2,994 teacher-forced API output tokens.
All three runs used Metal API validation and 4,096 allocated context; SSD
quality runs used a 64 GiB expert-cache budget.

| Weights and execution | Average NLL | API top-token agreement | Target logprob MAE |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Bootstrap, single-Mac SSD | 0.395514736 | 2692/2994 (89.91%) | 0.248143951 |
| Calibrated, single-Mac SSD | 0.364576009 | 2697/2994 (90.08%) | 0.227531809 |
| Calibrated, two-Mac RDMA TP | 0.366961107 | 2699/2994 (90.15%) | 0.228669737 |

Calibration lowers NLL by 7.82% on this set; top-token agreement is effectively
unchanged. Whole-prompt paired resampling gives a 95% interval of
`[-0.05563, -0.00745]` for the calibrated-minus-bootstrap NLL difference.
This supports the calibrated artifact, not universal superiority or bit-exact
API parity. The initial five-case subset had worse calibrated NLL, which is
why the broader comparison was required. TP uses a different reduction order;
real-weight partition tests and the independent API scores both pass.

Bootstrap SSD and TP passed all 17 short/boundary cases, including every
retrieval through 16,385 tokens. Calibrated SSD and TP passed cases 000-013
plus 016; the calibrated 16,383/16,384 cases were not separately repeated.
Real-weight incremental prefill and snapshot restoration preserved exact
next-token logits at all twelve tested boundaries through 16,385. Native
agent coding passed with `--think-level 25`; real HTTP read/edit/test loops
passed Chat, Responses replay/live-tail and Anthropic, including reversed
parallel tool results. A bootstrap SSD coding task began with 18,379 tokens
and reused its live prefix on every follow-up. Independent tests passed
without edits to the test files.

Production-mode calibrated benchmarks used `speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt`,
4,096 allocated context, 512-token prefill intervals and 128 greedy output
tokens per frontier, without speculation or API validation. These are single
sweeps, not three-run release medians. SSD used automatic cache sizing.

| Context frontier | SSD prefill / decode | RDMA TP prefill / decode |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 512 | 14.18 / 16.42 t/s | 25.87 / 25.85 t/s |
| 1024 | 17.21 / 16.61 t/s | 26.65 / 25.72 t/s |
| 1536 | 17.30 / 16.70 t/s | 26.54 / 25.63 t/s |
| 2048 | 17.16 / 16.35 t/s | 26.59 / 25.58 t/s |

These baseline runs used token-by-token prefill, before the layer-major SSD
schedule was added. Automatic SSD allocation planned about 92.5 GiB total, including
a 75.97 GiB expert cache. US swap grew to about 641 MiB during its agent run,
then remained bounded and decreased during benchmarking. TP held about
80.7 GiB per rank. No OOM, watchdog reset or reboot occurred.

Warning-free Metal builds, frontend sanitizer checks, shared kernel/cache tests
and focused older Flash/GLM continuation regressions passed. This is not full
release sign-off: no M3, larger-Mac residency, CUDA, ROCm or pipeline execution
was tested. Physical V4.1 TP cancellation/recovery was not specifically run;
single-host cancellation and shared transport protocol tests do not replace it.
At that revision, V4.1 vision, DSpark and native session batching were unsupported.

September 12 completion pass, Metal only; numerical qualifications are recorded below:

- Q2 full residency was exercised on a 512 GiB M3 Ultra. Its short official
  scores match the single-host SSD aggregates above. The main model occupies
  about 151.8 GiB; the 188.8 GiB Engram tables remain disk-only.
  Mixed-size prefill, cache/history, progress, snapshot and next-decode checks
  pass through 130,062 tokens on that Ultra, with no swap used. The bounded
  64 GiB-cache SSD counterpart passes through 113,678 tokens on M5 Max.
- Resident and SSD vision prompt tests pass, as does physical two-Mac RDMA
  vision. Independent BF16 encoder comparisons across four fixtures have cosine
  similarity 0.999677 through 0.999907. Six resident server image questions and
  the image-prefix cache suite pass. These are focused tests, not a vision benchmark.
- Physical TP cancellation/reuse passes on V4.1, older Flash and GLM. Rebuilt
  continuation logits are exact, with the same connection retained.
- Native SSD agent compaction/save/recovery checks pass at 4K and 64K on M5
  Max. The long coding turn retained 54,884 tokens; all 80 generated C functions
  compiled and passed an independent value check. Save/restore resumed tools
  with the cached prefix, and oversized-input rejection remained recoverable.
- Native vision-agent SSD checks pass at short and long context on M5 Max.
  The long run began with 53,945 tokens and reached 55,738, using a 73,728-token
  window. Both image-based code edits passed the independent oracle, and all
  six tool continuations reused the prefix without compaction. Planned memory
  was 102.32 GiB; the host reported about 1 MiB of swap afterward.
- Native decode isolation passes at 2/4/8 rows on the Ultra and 2/8 on RDMA,
  including two sessions at 64K on both. Eight-row, 64-step full-logit controls
  differ by at most 1.15e-5; intermediate layer-state comparisons are exact.
  Small expert kernels pass the consumed-output oracle at rows 1-9, and the
  batch output head passes scalar and independent double-reference checks.
- Resident native batches score the extended six-case set at NLL 0.558586174
  (two rows) and 0.558586151 (eight), versus scalar 0.558586149. API top-token
  agreement stays 327/384. TP native two-row scoring matches scalar aggregates:
  short NLL 0.361471746 versus 0.361471738, 2699/2994 top tokens; extended
  0.560655391 versus 0.560655370, 328/384. Complete manifests, finite values
  and count consistency were checked before comparing scores.
- Balanced timings without validation: Ultra two-row decode 34.1 versus
  19.7 aggregate t/s serial; eight-row 44.2 versus 19.9. Physical TP reaches
  36.1/40.7/45.7 aggregate t/s for 3/4/8 rows, versus about 30.8 serial.
  Two-row TP batching measured 29.0 versus 30.8 and is therefore not the
  default. These are balanced focused runs, not release-wide medians.
- Native mixed batches (1-7 prefix rows, eight total rows) pass complete-logit,
  invalid-input and subsequent-decode checks on the Ultra and physical TP.
  The Ultra long variant crosses 16K, 32K and 64K boundaries; maximum logit
  differences are 7.63e-6 on the Ultra and 5.73e-6 on TP. At 64K, seven prefix
  rows plus one decoder took 0.249 seconds versus 0.507 for serialized work.
  That timing was collected under validation, not as a release benchmark.
- Resident small prefills now batch from eight tokens. A 128-token append
  measured 0.74 versus 6.24 seconds on the Ultra. Official 100-case NLL is
  0.365680596 versus 0.364576009, with a paired 95% interval spanning zero
  (-0.00513 to 0.00766); API top-token agreement is 2705 versus 2697/2994.
  Continued-128 long scoring similarly shows no established regression;
  the two 64K/96K control cases improve target NLL. Complete-state checks
  were repeated through 130,062 tokens after this scheduling change.
- Real Pi image/code tasks pass Chat, Responses and Anthropic, with prefix
  reuse after both images. Eight-slot JSON/SSE identical short-prompt tests
  pass after cancelled requests. Mixed-length identical-pair tests pass with
  a fixed 2048-token prefill quantum; the default variable-geometry run is
  not bit-identical and is not reported as an exact-output pass.
- Native-agent generation interruption and immediate same-session tool
  recovery pass on M5 SSD streaming. Physical cancellation/reuse was repeated
  with protocol 12 on V4.1, older Flash and GLM. Older Flash Vision Experimental
  with its matching DSpark passes 512 TP target tokens with zero logit gap;
  GLM Flash Q4 retains its ten-case NLL 0.319056979 baseline.
- Earlier accepted RDMA timing reached 1111.30 t/s for 32K prefill,
  1083.48 t/s for continued prefill and 30.13 t/s for short-context decode.
  These supersede the token-by-token baseline table, but are not new release
  medians. Keep cold-start loading and cache handoff in subsequent comparisons.
- The first Q4 SSD scorer rebooted M5 US with a 92-second watchdog timeout:
  wired memory reached about 123.4 GiB despite only 76.69 GiB planned. The
  shared PRO/Q4 indirect expert-table path retained whole-layer residency
  outside the bounded cache. Full-table dispatch is now resident-only; SSD
  uses the selected-expert cache. The admission test fails on the old code
  and passes with the fix. Six-expert Q4/MXFP4 eviction/batch/release checks and
  the existing IQ2 suite pass under validation on M5 Max and M3 Ultra.
  A guarded 32 GiB-cache Q4 continuation passes with 31/32 API top tokens,
  about 30 GiB wired and no swap. The subsequent 64 GiB-cache Q4 scorer
  passes all 100 short prompts and nine 8K/16K/32K prompts: NLL 0.246523256
  and 0.335651410, API top-token agreement
  2896/2994 and 542/576. Short target-logprob MAE is 0.070084928 versus Q2's
  0.227531809; the paired short NLL difference interval is [-0.14129, -0.09452].
  Full result tables pass manifest, finite-value and count checks. Wired memory
  stayed bounded and swap remained zero. The reboot is not erased by the
  passing rerun.
- Calibrated Q2, Q4 and the vision encoder are published in
  `antirez/deepseek-v4.1-flash-gguf`. Q4 contains 294.15 GiB of main weights
  and 188.83 GiB of disk-only Engram data. Its two transport parts reconstruct
  the audited 518,596,067,328-byte GGUF without changing any tensor bytes.
  The actual Ultra download passed both part checks and the full SHA-256
  `a5e2e2c3ada4b2e98d9f9e4b50f6d9c2a12c2c96f5da165c07e13aff9264984e`.
  The downloader's eight-case offline suite passed on M5 Max and M3 Ultra.
- Q4 resident short scoring on the 512 GiB Ultra gives NLL 0.252409161,
  2896/2994 API top tokens and target-logprob MAE 0.070639113. Compared with
  M5 SSD above, the paired short NLL difference interval is
  [0.000496, 0.011493]: a small measurable difference, not bit-exact parity.
  The nine 8K/16K/32K cases give NLL 0.328760094 and 538/576 top tokens;
  their NLL difference interval [-0.02705, 0.01503] spans zero. Disabling
  layer-major prefill on the same Ultra reproduces the M5 SSD short-score
  file byte for byte. This isolates the short difference to batched versus
  scalar prefill, not residency or the host. The small target-NLL loss remains
  measured; unchanged top-token totals are not proof of numerical equivalence.
- The complete six-case Q4 64K/96K set on the Ultra scores NLL 0.366465846,
  360/384 API top tokens and target-logprob MAE 0.095093210. The resident Q2
  control scores 0.558586149, 327/384 and 0.358345897. Whole-prompt paired
  intervals favor Q4 for both NLL [-0.29963, -0.10130] and top-token agreement
  [0.046875, 0.132813]. All six cases and 384 targets passed the finite-value
  and count checks. This is a measured quantization comparison on the stored
  fixture, not a claim of exact hosted-model parity.
- Q4 resident state checks pass through 130,062 tokens: cache spans, Engram
  history, full logits, progress, snapshot restore and subsequent decode.
  Native eight-row decoding initially failed the 0.0002 full-logit bound with
  a 0.141911 difference. Reusing the scalar expert reductions through eight
  Q4 rows fixes it: the primitive is exact for all 27 solo/ownership shapes,
  while the old dispatch fails. Full-model eight-row controls pass 64 steps
  with a maximum difference of 1.53e-5. The tolerance was not increased.
- Q4 native eight-row official scoring gives NLL 0.252409123 versus serial
  0.252409161, with the same 2896/2994 API top-token matches. All seven mixed
  prefill/decode shapes and image replay/change/restoration checks pass.
  The final resident rerun stayed below 309.1 GiB wired, with zero swap.
- The shared MoE fixture now uses an explicitly unfused reference. Fused
  kernels need not write optional gate/up scratch; the test checks consumed
  intermediates and final outputs, retaining finite checks and exact bulk
  comparisons. The previous fixture stopped on untouched scratch on M3,
  before it could exercise the actual fused-output comparison.
- A 512-token warm-SSD batching threshold was not retained. Balanced timings
  reduced the append from about 29.2 to 16.8 seconds, but the nine long API
  cases scored NLL 0.578360615 versus 0.560790592 for the existing schedule;
  the paired difference interval [0.00456, 0.03568] does not support neutrality.
  The six extended cases show no established NLL difference, but do not negate
  this regression on the separate nine-case set.
  Keep the existing 1024-token threshold when at least half the experts fit.
- The six-case extended API set shows a TP-versus-M5-SSD NLL difference
  (0.560655 versus 0.540163). The M3 resident score is 0.558586. On the two
  dominant 64K/96K cases, M3 SSD and residency produce identical score files;
  M5 SSD with Metal 4 disabled also matches those files exactly. This isolates
  a hardware/kernel arithmetic difference from residency itself, but does not
  prove every TP difference harmless or establish bit-exact cross-host parity.
- A matched physical TP scalar-prefill control covers the two dominant 64K/96K
  prompts, with the same source, resident shards and 106,496-token allocation.
  Disabling layer-major prefill on both ranks gives NLL 0.705645662 and 101/128
  API top tokens; production batched prefill gives 0.689299268 and 105/128.
  The NLL changes have opposite signs across the two prompts, with a paired
  interval [-0.07303, 0.04034]. This small control does not establish general
  equivalence, but does not implicate batched prefill as the source of the
  earlier cross-path quality gap. Both ranks exited normally after about
  94 minutes, using about 84 GiB wired each with no swap growth.
- Warning-free focused Metal builds and Engram, GGUF, frontend, download,
  SSD-cache and expert-kernel regressions pass. Final forced builds and the
  Q4/IQ2 tiny-batch, shared MoE, three-quant SSD cache, table-admission, dispatch
  and finite-vision tests pass on the Ultra and both M5 Max hosts. CUDA, ROCm
  and pipeline support are outside this pass. No M3 Max inference was run on
  the editing machine.

Q4 full-resident timing on the 512 GiB M3 Ultra, September 12: default paths,
Engram disk-only, 36,864-token allocation, no Metal validation or speculation.
These are medians of three complete context sweeps after discarding a warmup;
each frontier generates 128 tokens. All retained runs produced identical,
coherent prose. Loading is excluded. Only the first row is an initial prefill;
the others append to the preceding frontier.

| Context frontier | Added tokens | Prefill t/s | Generation t/s |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 4,096 | 4,096 | 341.75 | 18.69 |
| 8,192 | 4,096 | 339.10 | 18.67 |
| 16,384 | 8,192 | 641.49 | 18.32 |

### CUDA SSD Streaming

V4.1 CUDA starts with text inference on a single DGX Spark. Test on
`toor@192.168.4.180` and `toor@192.168.4.181`, one model process per host.
Never load this Q2 model resident on a 128 GB Spark. Its 341 GiB file includes
189 GiB of disk-only Engram; the remaining weights still exceed RAM.

- Build with `make cuda-spark`, then `make CUDA_ARCH=sm_121
  tests/test_deepseek41_cuda tests/test_cuda_ssd_cache tests/test_cuda_q8_rows
  tests/test_deepseek41_prefill tests/test_cuda_ssd_batch
  tests/test_cuda_session_batch tests/test_cuda_mixed_batch`. Require warning-free builds.
- Run `tests/test_deepseek41_cuda`, its `--attention-output-large` mode,
  `tests/test_cuda_q8_rows`, and `tests/test_cuda_ssd_cache`. Check router ties,
  384 experts, long
  absolute RoPE positions, FP4/FP8 exponent range, masked sparse IDs, odd pair
  pooling, and the 8,192-row projection launch boundary. The cache oracle
  checks IQ2/Q2_K, Q4_K and MXFP4, eviction, remapped slots, small/zero and
  10,000-slot budgets, and prefill after its source becomes unreadable.
  Also check next-layer read-ahead: protect active inputs and pending slots,
  never publish partial reads, and evict unused read-ahead before demand-hot
  experts. Exercise cancellation, changed budgets/model descriptors and
  `tests/test_cuda_ssd_cache --prefetch-exit`; repeat with
  `DS4_CUDA_NO_DIRECT_IO=1` to cover buffered reads.
  Prefill must not accumulate full expert tensors in an unbounded second
  cache. Q8 row projections must match scalar execution
  with ragged shapes, untouched output tails and no padding after the weights.
- Repeat primitive and cache tests under Compute Sanitizer. On driver
  580.173.02, its host backtrace collector can itself crash; use
  `--show-backtrace device --report-api-errors no --error-exitcode 99` in
  that case. Device memory checking must remain enabled, with zero errors.
- Run `tests/test_deepseek41_prefill --cuda MODEL
  speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt`. This uses two sessions and a 64 GiB cache
  budget, mixing scalar decode with 256/1K/4K continued prefills. Check full
  saved state, logits, progress callbacks, cancellation, restore and subsequent
  decoding. Partial layer stacks must not be accepted as snapshots.
  Repeat with `--cuda-small` for the 24 short/large append transitions and
  `--cuda-long` for decoder/deferred-state boundaries through 60K. Short
  CUDA IQ2/Q2_K SSD prefills use exact 2..8-row chunks below the 256-token
  matrix-prefill threshold. Check both sides of each dispatch boundary.
  Compare CUDA SSD read-ahead and medium one-sweep appends with
  `DS4_CUDA_DISABLE_SSD_PREFETCH=1` and
  `DS4_CUDA_DISABLE_SSD_MEDIUM_SWEEP=1`. The optimized path must preserve
  complete logits and saved state. Time actual `/read README.md`, fresh and
  continued 1K/2K/4K/8K/32K prompts, and the following decode, with both
  automatic and explicit cache budgets. Check whether prefills displace
  useful decode experts, and report any decode regression alongside the
  prefill gain. Unused read-ahead must not count as an actual demand hit.
- Score the same V4.1 short general and long manifests used on Metal, not the
  V4 Flash vectors. Exercise 8/16/32K sparse frontiers and continued prefill.
  Compare paired probability scores, not sampled-prefix length alone.
- Run `make test-engram` and the Engram reader under ASAN/UBSAN. Parallel disk
  reads must preserve duplicate-row order, BF16 values, bounded scratch,
  error reporting and cleanup after truncated or invalid data.
- Test a native agent editing task and a server coding session with real tool
  calls. Check follow-up prefix reuse, concurrent requests, streaming client
  cancellation and reuse of the freed slots. V4.1 IQ2/Q2_K SSD supports native
  batches of 2..8 rows. Run the CUDA session oracle with two/eight sessions,
  including sparse frontiers, and the mixed oracle with five prefill plus
  three decode rows. A 128-token prefill plus three decode rows must exercise
  the ordered fallback. Require native-path counters and compare full logits,
  cache state, snapshots, session reorder and invalidation with isolated runs.
  Repeat `tests/test_cuda_ssd_batch` normally and under Compute Sanitizer.
- Monitor available host memory and swap through initial/continued prefill,
  decoding and reloads. Test automatic and explicit expert budgets. Confirm
  resident mode rejects an oversized model before warming or allocating it.
  Include 8K prefill chunks with an automatic cache near 80 GiB: prefill must
  schedule the active experts, not every slot in the global decode cache.
  Repeat older V4 Flash Q2 resident and SSD tests after shared CUDA changes.

First-port baseline, September 12, 2026, Spark Q2 SSD, 64 GiB budget: the 100-case general fixture
scores NLL **0.363135483**, API top-token agreement **2696/2994**, and target
log-probability MAE **0.223383502**. The validated Metal Q2 reference is
0.364576009, 2697/2994 and 0.227531809 respectively. These are quantized-model
quality measurements, not full-logit or bit-exact cross-backend comparisons.

The nine long cases through 32K score NLL **0.579366314**, **484/576** API
top tokens and target MAE **0.391980452**. The Metal TP reference is
0.573428934, 484/576 and 0.378944961; the best Metal prefill reference is
0.555252383, 488/576 and 0.360951107. The small long-context gap remains
visible; the short-test agreement does not establish cross-backend equivalence.
The final Q8, Engram-reader and compact-cache changes reproduce the baseline's
8K and 32K case score files byte-for-byte; the other seven long cases were
scored before these last optimizations.

The mixed-prefill test passes all nine appends through roughly 11K, including
complete state/logits, snapshots, partial-prefill cancellation, restore and
subsequent decode. Native and server coding tasks pass their unchanged tests
using actual read/edit/shell tool calls, with suffix-only follow-up prefills.
Paired concurrent streaming and nonstreaming requests pass, including slot
reuse after two cancelled streams. Older Flash 0731's ten-case focused check
scores NLL 0.416767410 and 204/240 API top tokens resident, versus 0.418845497
and 201/240 with SSD streaming. This is not a full older-model release pass;
Metal, ROCm, physical TP and larger V4.1 CUDA quants were not tested here.

Single-Spark Q2 SSD timing on September 12, automatic expert cache, Engram
disk-only and no speculation. Three complete sweeps with 32,768 allocated
context, 80.17 GiB of experts and 128 generated tokens per frontier:

| Context frontier | Added tokens | Prefill t/s | Generation t/s |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1,024 | 1,024 | 24.19 | 9.63 |
| 4,096 | 3,072 | 46.20 | 9.15 |
| 16,384 | 12,288 | 40.35 | 8.22 |

These are medians, not the best run. Reproduce with the command below using
`--ctx-start 1024 --ctx-max 16384 --step-mul 4 --ctx-alloc 32768 --gen-tokens 128`
instead of its context/generation options.

The separate 32K/40K run allocates 65,536 tokens and caches 79.82 GiB of
experts; it generated 64 tokens per frontier:

| Context frontier | Added tokens | Prefill t/s | Generation t/s | Runs |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 32,768 | 32,768 | 157.14 | 7.11 | One |
| 40,960 | 8,192 | 83.52 | 6.94 | One |

Recorded memory samples stayed above 6.5 GiB available host memory, with
no swap growth or system restart. Loading is excluded; generation includes
the first-token wait. Use `speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt` and:

```sh
./ds4-bench --cuda -m gguf/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-Q2.gguf --ssd-streaming \
  --prompt-file speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt --ctx-start 32768 --ctx-max 40960 \
  --step-incr 8192 --ctx-alloc 65536 --gen-tokens 64 --csv RESULT.csv
```

#### Prefill and Batching Update

September 12, `cd0bc133`, automatic SSD cache and disk-only Engram. Fresh
and continued size sweeps use 65,536 allocated context and 32 teacher-forced
decode tokens. Single measurements unless a repeat is listed:

| Existing tokens | Added tokens | Prefill t/s | Generation t/s |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 32 | 3.82 | 6.48 |
| 0 | 128 | 7.16 | 9.16 |
| 0 | 255 | 9.38 | 9.29 |
| 0 | 256 | 17.47 | 9.51 |
| 0 | 1,024 | 43.76 | 9.25 |
| 0 | 8,192 | 200.64 | 7.76 |
| 0 | 32,768 | 331.79 / 358.92 | 7.21 / 7.92 |
| 8,192 | 32 | 17.12 | 8.21 |
| 8,192 | 128 | 13.51 | 9.33 |
| 8,192 | 255 | 13.62 | 9.90 |
| 8,192 | 256 | 45.75 | 10.26 |
| 8,192 | 8,192 | 218.88 | 8.12 |
| 32,768 | 1,024 | 50.37 | 7.97 |
| 32,768 | 8,192 | 183.03 / 186.99 | 6.84 / 7.00 |

The large-prefill path improves on the first port, but these are not three-run
medians. Reproduce with the command above plus `--teacher-forced-decode` and
`--gen-tokens 32`; change start/max/step to select each fresh or continued case.
Do not compare cold small prompts with warm appends as a dispatch speedup.

All 100 general, 17 boundary, 12 medium continued and nine long continued
cases reproduce their accepted score baselines exactly after native batching
and exact short-prefill integration. Aligned expert prefill had earlier
improved the nine-case long score to NLL **0.558581488**, **491/576** API top
tokens and target MAE **0.372691664**. Repacking preserves weight bytes; its
fused arithmetic is not bit-identical to the first port. A lower matrix-prefill
cutoff was rejected after the long continued-context scores worsened.

The 24-append short-state test passes, as does the combined long-state test
through 60,298 tokens and fresh 49,153-token deferred replay: full caches,
logits, snapshots, cancellation, progress and next decode. Native session,
mixed-row and actual agent/server coding tests pass on the Sparks, including
stream cancellation and slot reuse. Older Flash 0731's focused ten-case SSD
score file remains byte-identical; this is not a full cross-backend release pass.

Eight sessions at 1K allocated context, 80.75 GiB expert cache, 24 decode
steps per session: balanced serial/native/native/serial runs average
**8.435 versus 10.957 aggregate t/s** for eight-row steps, a **29.9%** gain.
All four frontier, full-logit and argmax hashes match. Minimum sampled available
memory was 13.1 GiB, with no swap growth. Use `tests/test_cuda_session_batch`
with `DS4_TEST_CUDA_SINGLE_GPU=1`, `DS4_TEST_SSD_CACHE_GIB=auto`,
`DS4_TEST_SESSION_COUNT=8`, `DS4_TEST_BATCH_ONLY=1`, and the Q2 model in
`DS4_TEST_MODEL`. Set `DS4_CUDA_SESSION_BATCH_MOE=0` only for the serial control.
Mixed five-prefill/three-decode rows also pass exact parity; larger mixed
prefills retain the correct ordered fallback. These results do not establish
native CUDA network-TP batching or V4.1 vision support.

#### SSD Read-Ahead and Medium Appends

September 13-14, 2026, single Spark, V4.1 Q2 SSD, 64 GiB expert-cache hint
(56.88 GiB dynamic experts plus 7.12 GiB prefill reserve), disk-only Engram.
The control is `a04f46fa`. No arithmetic, expert selection or precision changes.
Read-ahead uses the admitted expert cache and two 8 MiB staging buffers;
it starts at 2K tokens when two layers fit. Reading ahead below that threshold
was slower and is not the default. Medium appends retain their existing
2048-row arithmetic partitions but visit each layer only once; small tails
and explicitly reduced prefill chunks retain their previous dispatch.

Actual `/read README.md`, 3,241 prompt tokens, 32K allocated context,
temperature zero, no thinking, 64 generated tokens, balanced two-run pairs:

| Path | Prefill t/s |
| --- | ---: |
| Control | 54.30 / 55.02 |
| One layer sweep, read-ahead disabled | 81.66 / 81.75 |
| One layer sweep and read-ahead | 97.88 / 98.60 |

All six 64-token continuations are identical. Generation overlaps the
control's range, around 6 t/s. Separate size checks use 64K allocated context,
`promessi_sposi.txt`, and 32 teacher-forced decode tokens per frontier.
These are single paired measurements, not medians:

| Existing tokens | Added tokens | Control prefill t/s | Optimized prefill t/s |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 2,048 | 69.31 | 84.90 |
| 2,048 | 2,048 | 76.67 | 90.70 |
| 0 | 4,096 | 101.44 | 116.34 |
| 4,096 | 4,096 | 105.15 | 116.31 |
| 0 | 8,192 | 202.72 | 228.44 |
| 8,192 | 4,096 | 102.03 | 111.15 |
| 0 | 32,768 | 350.47 | 384.45 |
| 32,768 | 3,241 | 54.21 | 87.77 |

Complete frontier logits match byte-for-byte in every pair. At the last two
frontiers, generation remains about 6.5 t/s. The mixed-state oracle passes
through 60,298 tokens and fresh 49,153-token deferred replay: full caches,
logits, snapshots, cancellation, progress and next decode. Available memory
stayed above 21 GiB with the two-session state oracle, without swap growth.
IQ2/Q2_K, Q4_K and MXFP4 cache tests, read failures, cancellation, descriptor
and budget changes, early exit and buffered fallback pass. Compute Sanitizer
reports zero errors; the SSD scalar/batch oracle also remains exact.

The 17 official boundary cases reproduce the control score file byte-for-byte:
NLL 0.405201234, API top-token agreement 126/141. The three long cases
`000`, `003` and `008` from `deepseek-v4.1-flash-20260911-long`, each with
a 3,241-token continued suffix, also reproduce the control exactly:
NLL 0.502778649, 172/192 API top tokens. The native agent reads and edits
the source, runs the four unchanged tests and completes its coding task.
The older Flash 0731 ten-case SSD score file is also unchanged:
NLL 0.418845497, 201/240 top tokens.
This is focused CUDA SSD QA, not a new Metal, ROCm or physical TP release pass.

With automatic sizing (80.17 GiB dynamic cache), the same 32K-context README
test reaches 93.18 / 96.41 t/s versus 49.45 / 53.80. Its short 64-token
decode timings vary: 6.58 / 7.42 versus 7.08 / 7.74 t/s. A balanced four-run
check with 256 generated tokens confirms a small decode cost in this case:

| Path | Prefill t/s | Generation t/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Optimized, first | 102.92 | 9.23 |
| Control, first | 51.30 | 9.81 |
| Control, second | 55.39 | 9.77 |
| Optimized, second | 100.25 | 9.39 |

All replies are identical. Prefill plus generation averages about 59 seconds
instead of 87, excluding model loading, but decode alone is about 5% slower.
Do not call this a decoding speedup or assume this short-reply result holds
for all prompts and reply lengths. Automatic-cache runs retain at least
6.59 GiB available memory with no swap growth; the agent retains over 13 GiB.

### CUDA Network Tensor Parallelism

Use the two Sparks above with identical commits and V4.1 Q2 files, one GPU
per rank. Expert shards are resident; Engram stays on disk. Do not combine
network TP with `--ssd-streaming`, `--cuda-tensor-parallel` or `--quality`.
The Linux transport uses RoCEv2 and host staging, not GPUDirect. Protocol 14
requires updating all peers together, including Metal peers.

- Build `tests/test_tp_commands`, `tests/test_tp_tcp`, `tests/test_tp_rdma`,
  `tests/test_tp_link`, `tests/test_cuda_tp` and `tests/test_cuda_ssd_batch`.
  Run the command/TCP/RDMA unit tests under ASAN/UBSAN. Tiny socket buffers,
  stalled peers, half-close and disconnect must fail promptly, not deadlock.
- Run the physical link test in both directions on each available direct
  link, with TCP and RDMA. Check the reported device, RoCEv2 GID and RC
  transport. A management-network ping is not an RDMA test. Stop a worker
  during exchange and require bounded coordinator failure.
- Run `tests/test_cuda_tp` normally and under Compute Sanitizer. Check
  device-to-host visibility, row/batch/bulk exchange, growing staging buffers,
  output canaries, failed-peer propagation, rebind and cleanup. Transport
  registration must be released before its staging buffers are freed.
- Run `tests/test_cuda_ssd_batch --owned` and `--owned-mmq`, including under
  Compute Sanitizer. Cover 5120-wide inputs with more than eight rows, both
  ranks, empty local contributions, three/six selections and 384 experts.
  The IQ2 lookup tables must be initialized even when activations exceed
  the small shared cache. Poison scratch buffers: absent owned assignments
  must not read unwritten gate/up/down outputs or compute placeholder experts.
  `--owned-mmq-large` also checks 8191/8192/8193 rows through the global
  assignment-map path. V4.1 small owned batches must match each rank's scalar
  partials exactly, not merely produce a close combined sum.
- Run `tests/test_cuda_tp_repack`, also under Compute Sanitizer. Compare
  aligned expert shards with independent raw shards and the whole expert
  table. Include empty rank contributions, poisoned scratch, output canaries,
  384 experts and the actual 5120/2304 dimensions. Small rows must be exact;
  large prefills must retain their validated accumulation order. The builder
  must reject invalid ranks and truncated mappings without touching Engram.
- Repeat the CUDA attention-output primitive checks with the TP projection
  enabled, including ragged rows, truncated weights and output tails.
- Run `tests/test_cuda_q8_rows`, including `--tp-head` under Compute
  Sanitizer. Both compact vocabulary halves must exactly match their rows
  in the full head, including native batches and untouched output tails.
  Check full logits after prefill, scalar decode, batch decode and restore;
  a missing worker half must fail rather than leave stale logits usable.
- Run `make test-cuda-reductions CUDA_ARCH=sm_121`, also with Compute
  Sanitizer memcheck and racecheck. Weighted RMS and FP32 projections must
  match the independent original reduction exactly, including zero inputs,
  mixed magnitudes, ragged widths, in-place normalization and output tails.
  Check model scores and timings too: a faster primitive alone does not
  establish an end-to-end speedup.
- Run `make test-cuda-shared CUDA_ARCH=sm_121` on Spark, also with
  Compute Sanitizer memcheck and racecheck. Concurrent shared/routed work
  must retain the serial result: exercise independent scratch users,
  captured graphs, changed inputs on replay, partial-launch failure and
  repeated cleanup/reinitialization. Verify model logits with graphs both
  enabled and disabled before accepting a scheduling change.
- Record CPU affinity on both ranks for paired timings. Spark has faster
  and slower CPU groups; compare the same allowed group and do not change
  system-wide CPU settings between runs.
- Run `tests/test_deepseek41_prefill --tensor-parallel-cuda MODEL
  speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt LISTEN_HOST PORT RDMA_DEVICE GID` against
  a worker with `--ctx 16384`. Require full-state/logit agreement, dispatch
  boundaries, progress callbacks, cancellation, snapshots and both-rank
  prefix replay. A cancelled rank must not leave its peer's frontier valid.
  Repeat with `--tensor-parallel-cuda-small` for short-append boundaries;
  the control must mirror scalar execution on the worker as well.
- Score general100, boundary17, medium continued12 and long continued9
  against the saved V4.1 API continuations. Include 32-token appends at
  sparse 8/16/32K frontiers. Compare paired case scores, not just coherent
  text or exact agreement with a differently rounded execution path.
- Run native-agent editing and actual server tool loops on the pair. Check
  follow-up prefix reuse, concurrent streaming/nonstreaming requests,
  cancellation and slot reuse. Include five through eight active sessions
  so native CUDA TP batching is exercised; smaller groups run in order.
  Eight 4K contexts fit the tested Sparks; eight 8K workspaces are rejected
  by memory admission. Do not weaken that guard to make the test fit.
- Run `tests/test_cuda_session_batch` with `DS4_TEST_SESSION_COUNT=8`,
  `DS4_TEST_TP_LISTEN_HOST` set to the direct-link address and a matching
  worker. Require exact full-vocabulary logits, reordered rows, invalid-input
  rejection and snapshot replay. Repeat with `DS4_CUDA_SESSION_BATCH_MOE=0`.
  Also test five, six and seven sessions against isolated scalar controls.
  Run `tests/test_cuda_mixed_batch` with both a five-token and a 128-token
  prefill quantum, checking native eight-row work and the ordered fallback.
  Measure native and ordered throughput separately from compilation and
  diagnostic instrumentation; do not enable slower small groups by default.
- Check CUDA decode graphs against `DS4_CUDA_DECODE_GRAPHS=0`. Use
  `DS4_CUDA_DECODE_GRAPH_LOG=1` in a separate diagnostic run to confirm
  capture on both ranks, not silent fallback. Cover alternating batch/scalar
  decode, scratch growth after continued prefill, cancelled work, snapshots,
  and freeing/recreating sessions. Require exact logits and unchanged official
  continuation scores. Repeat resident Flash 0731 regression checks because
  the backends share graph infrastructure.
  V4.1 captures three regions per layer: input projections, attention output,
  and the FFN. Position-dependent attention and network gates stay outside
  capture. Require all 120 regions on each rank in the scalar diagnostic.
- Monitor host memory and swap throughout startup, prefill and reload. Each
  rank should retain about 80.57 GiB of weights: 71.19 GiB of derived expert
  artifacts and 9.38 GiB of raw tensors. Do not retain duplicate raw experts,
  unowned experts or disk-only Engram. Check allocation bytes as well as
  payload bytes:
  large ranges must not waste most of their arena blocks. Use identical
  prompts/context limits for paired prefill and decode timings.

#### September 13 Results

V4.1 Q2 on `toor@192.168.4.180` and `.181`, CUDA 13, `sm_121`, direct
RoCE link. Head/projection checkpoint: `76d04e1f`. Engram remains disk-only;
no speculative decoding. Both CUDA builds completed without warnings.

Single-session decode uses the same 1K prose prompt, 64K allocated context
and 512 teacher-forced tokens. Balanced control/head/graphs/graphs/head/control
runs, without compilation or profiling during the measurements:

| Implementation | Decode t/s, two runs | Mean |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Decode graphs and five-row batching (`03f68a1e`) | 20.82 / 20.63 | 20.725 |
| Split vocabulary head (`5e15e257`) | 21.22 / 21.26 | 21.240 |
| Captured attention projections (`76d04e1f`) | 21.56 / 21.73 | 21.645 |

The combined gain is 4.4%; **30 t/s single-session decode is not achieved**.
Prefill at 1K remained around 202-210 t/s. A separate final run at 64K
allocation, with 64 teacher-forced decode tokens per frontier:

| Existing tokens | Added tokens | Prefill t/s | Decode t/s |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 32,768 | 395.51 | 20.15 |
| 32,768 | 8,192 | 269.49 | 20.27 |

These long-context figures are single measurements, not medians. The
benchmark replays the prefix between frontiers; that replay is not included
in the reported append time.

Eight-session batching at 1K allocation was measured separately before the
head split: ordered/native/native/ordered runs gave 20.9/27.1/29.0/20.7
aggregate t/s, or 20.8 versus 28.05 on average. Frontier, full-logit and
argmax hashes match in all four runs. Five, six and seven rows also beat
their ordered controls. Do not substitute one short oracle timing for this
paired throughput comparison or report aggregate throughput per client.

Final three-through-eight-session independent full-logit oracles pass with
zero differing logits, including reordered rows, snapshots and freeing and
recreating sessions. The per-session head fallback also passes at eight rows.
Mixed five-prefill/three-decode rows and the 128-token ordered fallback pass.
Normal and 24-append small-state tests pass caches, logits, progress,
cancellation, both-rank replay and subsequent decode.

All 138 official continuation cases are byte-identical to the accepted
pre-head score files: general100 NLL 0.364937088, boundary17 0.401415795,
medium12 0.523971083 and long9 0.566939577. The continued cases include
32-token appends at sparse 8/16/32K frontiers. The focused ten-case resident
Flash 0731 regression also remains byte-identical (NLL 0.416767410).

Native-agent editing passed four unchanged tests. The eight-session 4K HTTP
server passed tool-based editing, cached follow-up, 16 nonstreaming and 16
streaming requests, including two cancellations and slot reuse. Sampled
coordinator availability stayed above 14 GiB without swap growth. The model
emitted an unused extra tool argument, so this does not establish strict tool
schema adherence. Eight 8K sessions were correctly refused before allocation.

Q8 full/split primitives and device memory checks passed; Compute Sanitizer
reported zero device errors. Transport command/TCP/RDMA tests passed
ASAN/UBSAN, including missing, partial, malformed and stalled logit frames.
Their linked CPU engine objects were not instrumented. A ROCm host-only
warning-as-error syntax check passed; Metal/HIP GPU tests, vision, and the
64/96K official vectors were not run in this CUDA pass. This is not a full
release sign-off.

#### September 13 Dense-kernel Follow-up

Implementation: `64329ca2`, including the reductions in `742ea18a`.

Exact FP32 reductions use two block barriers instead of nine. Spark TP
also overlaps the shared expert with routed-expert work, using private
scratch and the existing BF16 rounding boundaries. No new weight format,
expert-count change or enable switch is involved.

Final control/new/new/control runs used Q2, a 1K prose prompt, 64K allocated
context and 2,048 teacher-forced decode tokens, without concurrent builds
or profiling:

| Implementation | Decode t/s, two runs | Mean |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Unchanged `f3e2e404` | 21.66 / 21.62 | 21.64 |
| Exact reductions and shared-expert overlap | 21.98 / 21.74 | 21.86 |

The combined gain is **1.0%**; 30 t/s is still not achieved. Prefill at 1K
stayed around 205-207 t/s. Reduction-only model timings were within run
variation: do not add its isolated kernel gains to the end-to-end gain.

Long-window comparison, 1,024 decode tokens at each frontier:

| Implementation | Existing tokens | Added tokens | Prefill t/s | Decode t/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Control | 0 | 32,768 | 397.06 | 20.38 |
| New | 0 | 32,768 | 406.93 | 20.86 |
| Control | 32,768 | 8,192 | 289.76 | 16.53 |
| New | 32,768 | 8,192 | 297.11 | 20.64 |

Long-context timings varied. An initial new-build 128-token append sample
was 16.92 t/s; its repeat was 20.82, versus 20.30 for a matched control.
The low result also occurred on the unchanged build over the longer window.
Its cause is not established; these single long runs do not establish a
percentage speedup. Prefix replay is excluded from append timing.

Separate 512-token CPU-group probes averaged 22.21 t/s on CPUs
`5-9,15-19` versus 21.49 on `0-4,10-14`, applying `taskset` to both ranks.
Those are the faster/slower groups on these two hosts, not portable CPU
numbers. This is not proof that CPU placement caused the long-run outlier.
No automatic affinity change or system-wide tuning was made.

The score files for all 138 official cases remain byte-identical to the
accepted control; general100 also matches with decode graphs disabled.
Three-, five- and eight-row full-logit oracles, mixed 5- and 128-token
prefills with three decoders, normal/small state, cancellation and both-rank
snapshot replay pass. Native agent editing and the eight-session HTTP
tool/stream/cancellation tests pass.
Older Flash 0731 resident10 and V4.1 SSD10 score rows match their respective
non-TP controls exactly.
Four paired 512-token older-Flash runs remained around 19.6 t/s before and
after the change, with no observed prefill regression.

The 126 reduction cases and shared-expert tests pass, including independent
scratch use, graph replay, partial failure, capture abort, oversized-scratch
fallback and reinitialization. Compute Sanitizer memcheck and racecheck are
clean. Both CUDA builds are warning-free. ROCm host syntax passes; the
strict CPU-only syntax check still reports three pre-existing unused static
declarations. Metal/HIP GPU tests, vision and official 64/96K vectors were
not run in this follow-up. This is not a full release sign-off.

#### September 13 Metal Portability Check

After consolidating the CUDA branch, both M5 Max hosts clean-built the normal
Metal binaries, scorer and focused tests without warnings. QA found a Darwin
TCP stall: `MSG_DONTWAIT` did not prevent `sendmsg` from blocking with small
buffers. The macOS exchange now temporarily sets `O_NONBLOCK` and restores
the original flags. Real TCP and socket-pair tests pass, including timeouts,
half-closes, bulk transfers and ASan/UBSan. Linked CPU engine objects were not
sanitized; LeakSanitizer is unsupported by this macOS runtime.

Updated the batch-admission fixture for the engine argument and the new shared
primitive fixtures for page-aligned Metal mappings, existing FP32 softplus
rounding and equal-score bitonic ordering. CUDA's stable-ID checks remain;
Metal checks sorted scores and unique IDs. No inference arithmetic changed.
The existing Metal router exactness tests pass with zero differing IDs,
weights or probabilities.

- Flash 0731: official vectors, local golden logits, session snapshots,
  short prefill and tool-call quality pass. Long-story golden logits are exact.
- V4.1 Q2 SSD: the first 20 general cases match the pre-CUDA Metal control
  byte-for-byte, NLL `0.416591342`, API top-token agreement `568/640`.
  Prefill frontiers 257/513/1025/1537/3585 retain exact logits, complete cache
  state and restored decode; interrupted layer-major work rebuilds correctly.
- V4.1 Q2 physical RDMA: the same 20 cases match the saved scalar-TP reference
  byte-for-byte, NLL `0.410415001`, API top-token agreement `567/640`.
  Four-session isolation passes complete logits, reordered rows, changed
  companions, mixed prefill and resumed decode with `native_ds41=1`.
  Decode/verify/bulk exchanges through 8,192 rows pass on both ranks.
  All nine cancellation/rebuild cases pass, including fresh and continued
  32K prefills with 64K allocated context.
- Engram, GGUF, quality API, frontend, session/transport, CLI thinking,
  memory-admission, V4.1 primitives, command-memory, SSD-cache, MoE prefill
  and MXFP4 tests pass. No swap growth or machine restart occurred.

This was a focused Metal regression pass, not a full release matrix. No local
M3 inference, large-Mac residency, GLM/pipeline regression, full vision workflow
or extended 64/96K official-quality pass was run. CUDA/HIP GPU tests were not
repeated during consolidation.
