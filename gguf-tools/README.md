# DS4 GGUF Tools

This directory contains the offline tools used to build and evaluate DeepSeek
V4 Flash GGUF files for `ds4`.

The important pieces are:

- `deepseek4-quantize.c`: C HF-safetensors to GGUF quantizer.
- `quants.[ch]`: the deliberately small local quantization implementation used
  by the quantizer.  It implements the DS4 output formats we actually ship:
  `q8_0`, `q8_K`, `q4_K`, `q2_K`, and `iq2_xxs`.
- `imatrix/`: dataset and instructions for collecting routed-MoE activation
  importance with `ds4`.
- `quality-testing/`: prompts and scripts used to compare local GGUF variants
  against official DeepSeek V4 Flash continuations.

## Qwen3.8 IQ2_XXS experiment

`qwen4_iq2.py` builds mixed IQ2_XXS/MXFP4 main weights with
embedded MTP. It quantizes the 48 trunk layers' gate/up experts directly from
the official BF16 checkpoint using the same pinned imatrix as the Q4_K pack.
It then copies every other tensor from an existing combined Q4_K `qwen4exp`
GGUF, including MXFP4 down projections, dense/control weights and MTP.
This isolates the gate/up precision change for a quality comparison.

The Python environment needs NumPy and `huggingface_hub`. Build the existing
native quantizer library with `make -C gguf-tools quants-shared`, then run:

```sh
python3 gguf-tools/qwen4_iq2.py quantize \
  --source /path/to/official-bf16-checkpoint \
  --imatrix /path/to/imatrix_unsloth.gguf_file \
  --library gguf-tools/libds4quants.dylib \
  --experts-dir /path/to/iq2-experts --threads 8

python3 gguf-tools/qwen4_iq2.py assemble \
  --template /path/to/combined-q4k-mtp-pleext.gguf \
  --experts-dir /path/to/iq2-experts \
  --out /path/to/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-IQ2XXSImatrix-MXFP4Down-MTP.gguf
```

The first stage can run beside the source checkpoint on another machine;
transfer the complete experts directory, including `experts.json`, for
assembly. Repeating the first command verifies completed tensors before
resuming. Assembly refuses existing outputs and verifies every written tensor
before publishing the completed GGUF and its JSON manifest.

The intermediate main model is approximately 50.3 GB. Finish it with the
[native n-gram packer](#native-qwen-n-grams) before inference. Quantization
changes model outputs; fitting weights on disk does not establish a 64 GB
runtime fit or acceptable reasoning quality. Compare with the same evaluator
settings using `ds4-eval --suite hard`.
### Experimental padded Q2_K down projections

Use `--projection down` on both stages to quantize the 48 trunk down
projections directly from BF16, with the pinned imatrix. Their 640 logical
inputs are zero-padded to 768 for three Q2_K blocks per row. Assemble against
the existing IQ2_XXS/MXFP4 combined model, using a new experts directory and
output path. All other tensors, including MTP, are copied unchanged:

```sh
uv run --with numpy --with huggingface_hub python gguf-tools/qwen4_iq2.py quantize \
  --projection down --source /path/to/official-bf16-checkpoint \
  --imatrix /path/to/imatrix_unsloth.gguf_file \
  --library gguf-tools/libds4quants.dylib \
  --experts-dir /path/to/q2-down-experts --threads 8
uv run --with numpy --with huggingface_hub python gguf-tools/qwen4_iq2.py assemble \
  --projection down --template /path/to/IQ2XXSImatrix-MXFP4Down-MTP.gguf \
  --experts-dir /path/to/q2-down-experts \
  --out /path/to/IQ2XXSImatrix-Q2KDownPad768-MTP.gguf
```

This layout requires the padded-down Qwen runtime support. The GGUF stores
physical dimensions `[768, 2560, 512]`; the architecture's expert width remains
640. Metal decode and prefill use the padded weight stride while reading only
640 activation columns. The CPU reference supplies zero activation padding.
The shared expert and MTP retain their original dimensions and formats.
Saving 88 bytes per trunk down row reduces the main model by 5.15625 GiB;
quality and speed must be evaluated for this new recipe.

### Native Qwen n-grams

Finish main-only packs with the original BF16 n-gram shards, not the old
quantized sidecar:

```sh
python3 gguf-tools/qwen4_native_ngrams.py \
  --model /path/to/IQ2XXSImatrix-Q2KDownPad768-MTP.gguf \
  --source /path/to/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next \
  --source-revision de4b8e4d43b917e7706784d8bb445c9af86a3540 \
  --output gguf/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Q2.gguf
```

The source directory needs its index and the safetensors shards containing
`ple.ple_embedding` tensors. The packer checks the hash constants, copies all
main/MTP tensor bytes unchanged, and appends the original BF16 table at a
page-aligned offset. It verifies every copied payload before publishing the
file and its checksum report. Allow space for the complete new file plus
16 GiB spare. An incomplete output is never a runnable release artifact.

For the Q4 pack, use its main GGUF as `--model`. `--source` can also be a
previously verified native n-gram GGUF from the same pinned checkpoint.
This avoids keeping a second copy of the original safetensors. The final
Q2 and Q4 files include 95.37 GiB of disk-only n-grams; no table precision
is lost, and the main-model quantization is unchanged.

## Build

```sh
make -C gguf-tools
```

The quantizer is plain C and does not link GGML.  GGUF metadata handling,
safetensors loading, FP4/FP8 dequantization, and the quantizers used by our Q2
and Q4 recipes live in this directory.

## Generate An Imatrix

First regenerate or inspect the calibration dataset:

```sh
python3 gguf-tools/imatrix/dataset/build_ds4_imatrix_dataset.py
```

Then collect activation statistics with the DS4 runtime:

```sh
./ds4 \
  -m gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Q4KExperts-F16HC-F16Compressor-F16Indexer-Q8Attn-Q8Shared-Q8Out-chat-v2.gguf \
  --imatrix-dataset gguf-tools/imatrix/dataset/rendered_prompts.txt \
  --imatrix-out gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-chat-v2-routed-moe-ds4.dat \
  --ctx 32768
```

The imatrix file is useful immediately with this DS4 quantizer.  Generic GGUF
tools need DS4-specific tensor-name mapping and per-expert slicing before they
can use it correctly.  The accepted imatrix format is the legacy llama.cpp
binary `.dat` file emitted by `ds4 --imatrix-out`.

Generating this `.dat` file locally is possible, but slow: it runs the DS4
prefill graph over the full calibration corpus and reads routed-MoE activation
statistics back from the GPU.  The latest published imatrix-generated GGUF files
are available in the antirez Hugging Face repository:

```text
https://huggingface.co/antirez/deepseek-v4-gguf/tree/main
```

## Generate Q2 And Q4 GGUFs

The template GGUF supplies metadata, tokenizer, tensor order, and logical
shapes.  Tensor bytes are regenerated from the Hugging Face safetensors.  Full
generation is intentionally offline and heavy: expect roughly 80-90 GB outputs
for the 2-bit template family and roughly 150-170 GB for the 4-bit routed-expert
family, plus enough free disk for the temporary output.  Use `--dry-run` and
`--compare-tensor` before starting a full write, and use `--overwrite` only when
you really mean to replace an existing GGUF.

Q2 routed experts with imatrix:

```sh
gguf-tools/deepseek4-quantize \
  --hf ../deepseek-v4-quants/hf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash \
  --template gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-IQ2XXS-w2Q2K-AProjQ8-SExpQ8-OutQ8-chat-v2.gguf \
  --out gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-IQ2XXS-w2Q2K-AProjQ8-SExpQ8-OutQ8-chat-v2-imatrix.gguf \
  --imatrix gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-chat-v2-routed-moe-ds4.dat
```

Q4 routed experts with imatrix:

```sh
gguf-tools/deepseek4-quantize \
  --hf ../deepseek-v4-quants/hf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash \
  --template gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Q4KExperts-F16HC-F16Compressor-F16Indexer-Q8Attn-Q8Shared-Q8Out-chat-v2.gguf \
  --out gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Q4KExperts-F16HC-F16Compressor-F16Indexer-Q8Attn-Q8Shared-Q8Out-chat-v2-imatrix.gguf \
  --imatrix gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-chat-v2-routed-moe-ds4.dat
```

True Q8_K routed experts:

```sh
gguf-tools/deepseek4-quantize \
  --hf ../deepseek-v4-quants/hf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash \
  --template gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Q4KExperts-F16HC-F16Compressor-F16Indexer-Q8Attn-Q8Shared-Q8Out-chat-v2-imatrix.gguf \
  --out gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Q8KExperts-F16HC-F16Compressor-F16Indexer-Q8Attn-Q8Shared-Q8Out-chat-v2.gguf \
  --experts q8_K \
  --threads 8
```

You can override tensor families:

```sh
--experts iq2_xxs
--routed-w2 q2_k
--attention-proj q8_0
--shared q8_0
--output q8_0
```

Useful checks before writing a full model:

```sh
gguf-tools/deepseek4-quantize \
  --hf ../deepseek-v4-quants/hf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash \
  --template MODEL.gguf \
  --compare-tensor blk.0.attn_q_a.weight
```

`--compare-tensor` regenerates a single tensor and byte-compares it against the
template or `--compare-gguf`.  `--threads N` controls routed-expert workers.

## Convert DeepSeek V4.1 Flash

V4.1 uses its own converter; a V4 template is not compatible. Install NumPy,
tokenizers and SymPy, then build the quantizer library:

```sh
make -C gguf-tools libds4quants.dylib
python3 gguf-tools/deepseek41_quantize.py \
  --hf models/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash \
  --source-revision df42c109f1defefcbfcedbe7d905718a12266e40 \
  --out gguf/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-IQ2_XXS-Q2_K-bootstrap.gguf --dry-run
```

Omit `--dry-run` to write the file. Add `--resume` after an interrupted conversion.
Use `libds4quants.so` on Linux. Gate/up experts use IQ2_XXS and down experts use
Q2_K; attention, shared experts and the output head use Q8_0. Engram rows retain
their original FP8 values and scales, packed together at the end of the GGUF for
disk lookups. Vision and DSpark weights are not included.

The first conversion uses weight-energy importance for IQ2_XXS. After runtime
calibration, add `--imatrix FILE` and choose a new output filename to regenerate
from the original safetensors. Do not requantize the first GGUF.

For Q4, add `--quant q4` and use `DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-Q4.gguf` as the output.
This changes only the routed experts to Q4_K; the other tensor formats and
disk-only Engram layout stay the same. The same imatrix works for both recipes.

Check the finished artifact against the pinned source before running it:

```sh
python3 gguf-tools/deepseek41_validate_gguf.py \
  --hf models/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash \
  --source-revision df42c109f1defefcbfcedbe7d905718a12266e40 \
  --gguf gguf/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-IQ2_XXS-Q2_K-bootstrap.gguf --payload
```

For a calibrated file, pass the same `--imatrix FILE` used during conversion.
Pass `--quant q4` to the audit as well when checking a Q4 file.
The audit checks the complete layout, all non-expert tensors, sampled experts
and native Engram rows. It does not replace [inference quality tests](quality-testing/deepseek-v4.1-flash-20260910/README.md).

## Convert A DSpark Support Checkpoint

The DSpark Flash checkpoint is published as Hugging Face safetensors and stores
the draft module under `mtp.0`, `mtp.1`, and `mtp.2`.  Before writing a support
GGUF, inspect the official index and verify that every DSpark tensor name is
understood by the converter:

```sh
gguf-tools/deepseek4-quantize \
  --hf ../deepseek-v4-quants/hf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731 \
  --dspark-manifest > /tmp/dspark-manifest.tsv
```

The manifest reads only `model.safetensors.index.json`; it does not require the
large shard files to be present.  The final summary should report three DSpark
stages and zero unknown DSpark tensors before attempting a full conversion.

To build the support GGUF used by `ds4 --mtp`, run the DSpark support mode.  This
mode writes standalone DSpark metadata plus the packed `mtp.*` tensor payloads;
it does not require a base-model GGUF template:

```sh
gguf-tools/deepseek4-quantize \
  --hf ../deepseek-v4-quants/hf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731 \
  --dspark-support \
  --out DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark-support-0731.gguf
```

`--dspark-support --dry-run` reads safetensors shard headers to derive exact
GGUF shapes and types, but it does not read tensor payloads.  The DSpark metadata
defaults match the published Flash DSpark config: block size 5, target layers
40,41,42, Markov rank 256, and noise token 128799.  Override them with
`--dspark-block-size`, `--dspark-target-layers`, `--dspark-markov-rank`, and
`--dspark-noise-token-id` if converting a different checkpoint.

Before a full write, regenerate one support tensor and record its checksum:

```sh
gguf-tools/deepseek4-quantize \
  --hf ../deepseek-v4-quants/hf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731 \
  --dspark-support \
  --compare-tensor mtp.0.main_proj.weight
```

This reads only the payloads needed for that tensor.  Add `--compare-gguf
DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark-support-0731.gguf` to byte-compare against an existing
support GGUF.

## When No Imatrix Is Given

`iq2_xxs` requires an importance vector.  If `--imatrix` is not provided and
the target type requires one, `deepseek4-quantize` computes a synthetic fallback
from the dequantized weight itself:

```text
importance[column] = sum(row[column]^2) over all rows
```

This is a weight-energy heuristic.  It is not as good as measuring real DS4
activations, but it gives the quantizer a stable column weighting and was good
enough for the first working 2-bit GGUFs.

## Quality Testing

See `quality-testing/README.md`.  The short version is:

```sh
python3 gguf-tools/quality-testing/collect_official.py
make -C gguf-tools quality-score
gguf-tools/quality-testing/score_official MODEL.gguf gguf-tools/quality-testing/data/manifest.tsv /tmp/model.tsv 4096
python3 gguf-tools/quality-testing/compare_scores.py /tmp/old.tsv /tmp/new.tsv
```

## Qwen3.8 Flash Next

`qwen4_exp_convert.py` wraps llama.cpp's `convert_hf_to_gguf.py` and writes
the `qwen4exp` schema DS4 loads, including the MTP block as `blk.<n>.nextn.*`.
It needs a llama.cpp master checkout (b96806d96 or newer, found through
`--llama-cpp` or `$LLAMA_CPP`) and a Python with torch, safetensors and
transformers, such as llama.cpp's own venv:

```sh
python gguf-tools/qwen4_exp_convert.py --src /path/to/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next \
  --source-revision de4b8e4d43b917e7706784d8bb445c9af86a3540 \
  --out Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Q8.gguf --outtype q8_0
python gguf-tools/qwen4_exp_convert.py --src /path/to/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next \
  --source-revision de4b8e4d43b917e7706784d8bb445c9af86a3540 \
  --out Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MXFP4.gguf --outtype q8_0 --experts mxfp4
```

Options: `--outtype q8_0|f32` (dense projections), `--experts
q8_0|mxfp4|q4_k|f32` (routed experts; `--experts-down` picks the 640-wide down
projection type when the gate/up type needs 256-wide rows), `--hc-type f16|f32|q8_0`
(hyper-connection mixers), `--indexer bf16|f16|q8_0|f32` (the QSA indexer
projections, kept at the released BF16 by default), `--no-mtp` and
`--dry-run`. Norms, conv kernels, `ssm_a`, dt biases and the routers stay F32.
N-grams always retain the original BF16 bytes. The converter finishes through
the native packer above; its temporary main-weight file is removed on success.
`gen_qwen4_unicode.py` regenerates `ds4_qwen4_unicode.inc` for the `qwen35`
pre-tokenizer from a current `regex` release.

`make test-qwen4-kernels` runs the Metal kernel tests and
`make test-qwen4-vision` checks the vision tower against the HF implementation
(`tests/qwen4_vision_ref.py`).
